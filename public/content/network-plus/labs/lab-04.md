## üö® Part 4: Troubleshooting Subnet Misconfigurations

GlobalTech's network has several configuration issues. Analyze each scenario and identify the problem.

### Scenario 1: Communication Failure

**Device A:**
- IP Address: 192.168.1.50
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

**Device B:**
- IP Address: 192.168.1.200
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.128

**Problem:** Device A can't communicate with Device B.

**Your Analysis:**
1. What is Device A's network address?
2. What is Device B's network address?
3. Are they on the same network?
4. What's causing the problem?
5. How would you fix it?

---

### Scenario 2: IP Address Conflict

**Network:** 10.0.5.0/27

**Assigned IPs:**
- Server: 10.0.5.0
- Workstation 1: 10.0.5.1
- Workstation 2: 10.0.5.31
- Printer: 10.0.5.15

**Problems reported:**

3. Which IPs are incorrectly assigned?
4. Why are they incorrect?
5. What IPs should be used instead?

---

### Scenario 3: Insufficient Capacity

**Network:** 192.168.50.0/28  
**Requirements:** 20 devices (computers, printers, phones)

**Your Analysis:**
1. How many usable hosts does /28 provide?
2. Is this subnet mask sufficient?
3. If not, what's the minimum CIDR that would work?
4. How many IPs would be wasted with your recommendation?
5. What's the trade-off between efficiency and growth?

---

### Scenario 4: Wasteful Allocation

**Network:** 172.16.10.0/24  
**Actual Usage:** Only 10 devices connected

**Your Analysis:**
1. How many usable hosts does this network provide?
2. How many hosts are being wasted?
3. What's a more efficient subnet mask?
4. What are the pros and cons of right-sizing vs over-provisioning?

## üé® Part 5: Design Challenge - Multi-Department Network

GlobalTech is opening a new office with four departments. Design an efficient IP addressing scheme.

**Given:**
- Base Network: 192.168.100.0/24
- You must divide this into 4 department subnets

**Department Requirements:**
1. **Sales:** 50 devices
2. **Engineering:** 25 devices
3. **HR:** 10 devices
4. **Management:** 5 devices

**Your Task:**
Design a subnet allocation that:
- Meets each department's needs
- Allows for 30% growth
- Minimizes IP waste
- Doesn't overlap

### Your Design:

**Sales Department:**
```
Subnet:              ___________________
Subnet Mask:         ___________________
CIDR:                ___________________
Network Address:     ___________________
Usable Range:        ___________________ to ___________________
Broadcast:           ___________________
Usable Hosts:        ___________________
Growth Capacity:     ___________________ (current + 30%)
```

**Engineering Department:**
```
Subnet:              ___________________
Subnet Mask:         ___________________
CIDR:                ___________________
Network Address:     ___________________
Usable Range:        ___________________ to ___________________
Broadcast:           ___________________
Usable Hosts:        ___________________
Growth Capacity:     ___________________ (current + 30%)
```

**HR Department:**
```
Subnet:              ___________________
Subnet Mask:         ___________________
CIDR:                ___________________
Network Address:     ___________________
Usable Range:        ___________________ to ___________________
Broadcast:           ___________________
Usable Hosts:        ___________________
Growth Capacity:     ___________________ (current + 30%)
```

**Management Department:**
```
Subnet:              ___________________
Subnet Mask:         ___________________
CIDR:                ___________________
Network Address:     ___________________
Usable Range:        ___________________ to ___________________
Broadcast:           ___________________
Usable Hosts:        ___________________
Growth Capacity:     ___________________ (current + 30%)
```

**Design Questions:**
1. Did you assign larger subnets first or last? Why?
2. How did you handle the 30% growth requirement?
3. What would you do differently if Sales needed 200 devices?
4. Explain your rationale for each subnet size choice.

## üß™ Part 6: Subnet Mask Identification Game

Look at these IP configurations and identify issues:

### Configuration 1:
```
IP: 10.50.100.75
Mask: 255.255.255.192
Gateway: 10.50.100.1
```
**Questions:**
- What network is this IP on?
- Is the gateway on the same network?
- Will this work? Why or why not?

---

### Configuration 2:
```
IP: 172.20.50.130
Mask: 255.255.255.128
Gateway: 172.20.50.129
```
**Questions:**
- What's the network address?
- What's the broadcast address?
- Is this configuration valid?

---

### Configuration 3:
```
IP: 192.168.1.254
Mask: 255.255.255.252
Gateway: 192.168.1.253
```
**Questions:**
- How many usable hosts in this network?
- Is 192.168.1.254 a valid host IP?
- What's wrong (if anything)?

---

### Configuration 4:
```
Device A: 10.0.0.50 / 255.255.255.240
Device B: 10.0.0.65 / 255.255.255.240
```
**Questions:**
- Can these devices communicate directly?
- What are their respective network addresses?
- If they can't communicate, why not?

- Device A network: 192.168.1.0/24
- Device B network: 192.168.1.128/25 (different!)
- They're on different networks due to mismatched masks
- Fix: Set both to 255.255.255.0 (/24)

**Scenario 2:**
- Network: 10.0.5.0
- Broadcast: 10.0.5.31
- Issues: Server has network address (.0), Workstation 2 has broadcast (.31)
- Fix: Server ‚Üí 10.0.5.1, Workstation 2 ‚Üí any IP from .2-.30

**Scenario 3:**
- /28 provides only 14 hosts (insufficient for 20)
- Need minimum /27 (30 hosts)
- Wastes 10 IPs
- Trade-off: Efficiency vs growth room

**Scenario 4:**
- /24 provides 254 hosts (244 wasted!)
- More efficient: /28 (14 hosts) or /27 (30 hosts)
- Consider: Right-sizing saves IPs but limits growth

**Recommended Approach:** Allocate largest first

**Sales (needs 50, allow 65):**
- Subnet: 192.168.100.0/26
- Usable: 62 hosts
- Range: .1 to .62
- Broadcast: .63

**Engineering (needs 25, allow 33):**
- Subnet: 192.168.100.64/26
- Usable: 62 hosts
- Range: .65 to .126
- Broadcast: .127

**HR (needs 10, allow 13):**
- Subnet: 192.168.100.128/28
- Usable: 14 hosts
- Range: .129 to .142
- Broadcast: .143

**Management (needs 5, allow 7):**
- Subnet: 192.168.100.144/29
- Usable: 6 hosts
- Range: .145 to .150
- Broadcast: .151

*Alternative valid solutions exist!*

<summary>Part 6: Identification Game - Expand for Answers</summary>

**Configuration 1:**
- Network: 10.50.100.0/26 (.0 to .63)
- Gateway .1 is on same network ‚úÖ
- Valid configuration

**Configuration 2:**
- Network: 172.20.50.128/25 (.128 to .255)
- Broadcast: 172.20.50.255
- Gateway .129 is on same network ‚úÖ
- Valid configuration

**Configuration 3:**
- /30 has 2 usable hosts (.1 and .2)
- Network: 192.168.1.252
- .253 = first usable, .254 = second usable
- **Problem:** This is actually the BROADCAST address of a /30!
- Should be network .252, usable .253-.254, broadcast .255

**Configuration 4:**
- Device A: 10.0.0.48/28 (network .48, range .49-.62, broadcast .63)
- Device B: 10.0.0.64/28 (network .64, range .65-.78, broadcast .79)
- **No!** Different networks, cannot communicate directly

## üéì Lab Reflection

Answer these questions to consolidate your learning:

1. **Which part was most challenging? Why?**

2. **What's your process for converting CIDR to dotted decimal now?**

3. **Can you calculate usable hosts in your head for /24-/30?**

4. **What real-world scenario made subnet masks "click" for you?**

5. **What would you teach differently if explaining this to someone else?**

## üöÄ Extra Credit Challenges

Want to push yourself further?

1. **Calculator Ban:** Redo Part 2 without a calculator. Time yourself!

2. **Speed Challenge:** Convert /24 through /30 to dotted decimal in under 60 seconds.

3. **Reverse Engineering:** Given 192.168.50.75/27, determine which subnet this IP belongs to (network address).

4. **Real-World Application:** Examine your home network. Document your IP, mask, gateway, and draw a subnet diagram.

5. **Efficiency Analysis:** For the Part 5 design, calculate total IP waste percentage across all four departments.

## üéØ What You've Accomplished

By completing this lab, you've:

‚úÖ Mastered CIDR notation and dotted decimal conversions  
‚úÖ Calculated usable hosts like a pro  
‚úÖ Identified network boundaries and key addresses  
‚úÖ Troubleshot real-world subnet issues  
‚úÖ Designed efficient multi-subnet networks  
‚úÖ Developed critical thinking for subnet analysis

**You're now ready for Lesson 5: Subnetting Fundamentals!**

This lab gave you hands-on experience with the tools every network engineer uses daily. In the next lesson, we'll take these skills and learn to actively **divide** networks into smaller subnets‚Äîthe real art of network design.

**Outstanding work! üéâ**
