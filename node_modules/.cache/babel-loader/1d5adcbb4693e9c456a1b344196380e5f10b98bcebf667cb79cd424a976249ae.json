The key indicators are: (1) all devices connect to a central device (the switch), (2) each device has a dedicated cable to the center, and (3) when the central device fails, the entire network goes down (single point of failure). Star topology is the most common physical topology in modern networks. Bus topology is incorrect because devices share a single cable (not dedicated cables).

However, the budget won't support connecting every office directly to every other office. How many total connections would be needed for a full mesh topology connecting all five offices?\",\n  options: [\"10 connections - using the formula n(n-1)/2\", \"5 connections - one per office\", \"20 connections - connecting each office to all others\", \"15 connections - based on office pairs\"],\n  correct: 0,\n  explanation: \"The correct answer is 10 connections. Full mesh topology uses the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of devices. With 5 offices: 5(5-1)/2 = 5(4)/2 = 20/2 = 10 connections. This means every office has a direct connection to every other office. However, the scenario suggests this is too expensive, so the company should use partial mesh instead, where only critical connections are redundant. 5 connections would be insufficient for full mesh (that's just one connection per office). 20 and 15 are incorrect calculations of the formula.\"\n}, {\n  id: 3,\n  question: \"A network technician is troubleshooting connectivity issues in an older building. The network uses a single coaxial cable that runs through the entire floor, with each computer 'tapping' into this cable. When one section of the cable was accidentally cut during construction, the entire network went down. Additionally, the technician is having difficulty determining exactly where the break occurred. What topology is being used, and why is it problematic?\",\n  options: [\"Star topology - central switch failure causes network-wide outage\", \"Ring topology - break in the circle stops token passing\", \"Bus topology - single point of failure makes the entire network vulnerable and difficult to troubleshoot\", \"Mesh topology - multiple connection failures are cascading\"],\n  correct: 2,\n  explanation: \"This is a bus topology, and it perfectly illustrates why bus topology is obsolete. Key indicators: (1) single coaxial cable running through the building, (2) devices 'tap' into the shared cable, (3) any break in the cable brings down the entire network, and (4) very difficult to locate the break. Bus topology has a single point of failure along its entire length - a break anywhere stops all communication. Modern networks use star topology with switches, where cable breaks only affect individual devices. Ring topology would be circular, not a single run. Mesh would have multiple redundant paths preventing total failure.\"\n}, {\n  id: 4,\n  question: \"A university campus network connects buildings using fiber optic cables. The main administration building connects to all four academic buildings. The two largest academic buildings also have a direct fiber connection to each other for high-bandwidth research data transfers. The network can survive the failure of any single fiber connection. What type of topology best describes this network design?\",\n  options: [\"Partial mesh - critical connections have redundancy without connecting everything to everything\", \"Full mesh - every building connects to every other building\", \"Star - all buildings connect only to the administration building\", \"Hybrid star-ring - combination of star and ring topologies\"],\n  correct: 0,\n  explanation: \"This is a partial mesh topology. The key indicators are: (1) not every building connects to every building (which would be full mesh requiring 10 connections for 5 buildings), (2) the central administration building connects to all others (hub-like), (3) the two largest buildings have an additional direct connection for redundancy and high bandwidth, and (4) the network can survive single connection failures. Partial mesh provides strategic redundancy where it's needed most without the cost of full mesh. Full mesh is incorrect because not all buildings connect directly to each other. Pure star is incorrect because the two academic buildings have a direct connection bypassing the central hub. This isn't a hybrid star-ring because there's no ring topology present.\"\n}, {\n  id: 5,\n  question: \"A company needs to connect their main office to a remote data center 15 miles away. They want a dedicated, private connection with guaranteed bandwidth that doesn't share infrastructure with other companies. The connection will only link these two specific locations. What topology would best describe this connection?\",\n  options: [\"Point-to-multipoint - one location connecting to multiple sites\", \"Mesh - multiple interconnected paths for redundancy\", \"Star - centralized connection hub with multiple endpoints\", \"Point-to-point - direct connection between exactly two locations\"],\n  correct: 3,\n  explanation: \"This is a point-to-point topology. The key indicators are: (1) connects exactly two locations, (2) dedicated connection (not shared), (3) direct link between endpoints. Point-to-point is the simplest topology and is commonly used for WAN connections between two sites, such as leased lines, fiber connections, or wireless bridges. This could be implemented using dedicated fiber, a T1/T3 line, or wireless point-to-point bridges. Point-to-multipoint is incorrect because it involves one central location connecting to multiple endpoints (like a radio tower to multiple receivers). Mesh requires three or more sites with multiple interconnections. Star requires three or more endpoints connecting to a central hub.\"\n}, {\n  id: 6,\n  question: \"A network administrator discovers that when one computer on the network fails, only that specific computer loses connectivity while all other 200 computers continue working normally. However, during a recent incident when the main switch in the server room failed, the entire network went down simultaneously.

This is clearly a star topology (individual computer failures don't affect others, all computers connect to a central switch). While star topology is excellent for isolating failures to individual devices and easy to manage, the central switch/hub represents a single point of failure - if it fails, the entire network goes down. This can be mitigated by using redundant switches with technologies like HSRP or VRRP. The other options are incorrect: adding computers to star topology is actually very easy (just plug into an available port), cable requirements are moderate (not as low as bus but acceptable), and modern switched star networks don't have collision domain issues (each switch port is its own collision domain).\"\n}, {\n  id: 7,\n  question: \"A financial services company is designing their new headquarters network. Each floor will use star topology with computers connecting to access switches. These access switches will connect to two redundant core switches in the data center using multiple fiber links. The core switches are also connected to each other. The company also has partial mesh connections to their three branch offices.

The network uses: (1) star topology at the access layer (computers to switches), (2) partial mesh between access switches and core switches (multiple redundant paths), (3) mesh between the core switches themselves, and (4) partial mesh for WAN connections to branch offices. Most real-world networks are hybrid because different topologies serve different purposes - star for easy management at the edge, mesh for redundancy in the core, and partial mesh for WAN connections. Pure star is incorrect because of the mesh elements. Pure mesh is incorrect because not everything connects to everything. Bus topology doesn't fit this design at all.\"\n}, {\n  id: 8,\n  question: \"An IT manager is comparing network topologies for a new 100-person office. She needs to ensure that: (1) if one computer's network cable fails, only that computer is affected, (2) the network is easy to troubleshoot and manage, and (3) new computers can be easily added without disrupting existing connections. However, she's concerned about what happens if the main networking equipment fails. Which topology should she choose, and what should she implement to address the concern?\",\n  options: [\"Mesh topology to provide multiple paths between all devices\", \"Star topology with redundant core switches to eliminate single point of failure\", \"Bus topology with multiple termination points for reliability\", \"Ring topology with dual counter-rotating rings for redundancy\"],\n  correct: 1,\n  explanation: \"Star topology with redundant core switches is the best solution. Star topology perfectly meets requirements 1-3: individual cable failures are isolated (only affects one computer), it's the easiest topology to troubleshoot (just check the central switch and the specific connection), and adding computers is simple (plug into available switch port). The single point of failure concern is addressed by using redundant switches with first-hop redundancy protocols (HSRP/VRRP) and link aggregation. Full mesh is impractical for 100 computers (would require 4,950 connections using n(n-1)/2 formula) and is expensive and complex. Bus topology is obsolete - it doesn't meet any of the requirements well and is very difficult to troubleshoot. Ring topology is also mostly obsolete and doesn't meet the easy management requirement.\"\n}, {\n  id: 9,\n  question: \"A healthcare organization has three buildings on their campus. Building A (administration) connects to Building B (clinic) and Building C (hospital). Buildings B and C also have a direct connection between them for fast medical record transfers. If any single connection fails, all buildings can still communicate. How many connections would be needed to upgrade this to a full mesh topology?\",\n  options: [\"1 - need one more connection to complete the mesh\", \"3 - need to triple the existing connections\", \"6 - need to add 3 more connections for full redundancy\", \"0 - it's already full mesh with 3 connections\"],\n  correct: 3,\n  explanation: \"This is already a full mesh topology with 3 connections. For a full mesh with 3 buildings, the formula n(n-1)/2 gives us: 3(3-1)/2 = 3(2)/2 = 3 connections. The description confirms all three connections exist: A-B, A-C, and B-C. In full mesh, every device connects directly to every other device. Since the problem states 'if any single connection fails, all buildings can still communicate,' this confirms full mesh - each building has two connections, so losing one still leaves a path. With only 3 buildings, full mesh is practical and affordable. As the number of devices grows, full mesh becomes impractical (10 devices = 45 connections, 20 devices = 190 connections), which is why partial mesh is more common in larger networks.\"\n}, {\n  id: 10,\n  question: \"A network technician is documenting the company's network design. She observes that the physical cabling shows all computers running cables to a central wiring closet where they connect to switches. However, when she analyzes how data actually flows through the network, she discovers that data is broadcast to all devices on each segment, similar to older hub-based networks. What is the relationship between physical and logical topology in this scenario?\",\n  options: [\"Physical and logical topologies are both star because switches create star networks\", \"Physical topology is bus, but logical topology is star due to switch intelligence\", \"Physical topology is star, but logical topology behaves like bus due to hub usage or misconfiguration\", \"Physical topology is mesh, but logical topology is star due to centralized routing\"],\n  correct: 2,\n  explanation: \"The physical topology is star (all cables run to a central point), but the logical topology behaves like bus (data broadcast to all devices). This scenario describes either: (1) use of hubs instead of switches (hubs physically create star topology but logically operate as bus, broadcasting all traffic to all ports), or (2) switches operating in hub mode or with a misconfiguration. This is an important concept - physical topology (how cables are arranged) can differ from logical topology (how data flows). Modern switched networks are physically star and logically star (switches intelligently forward frames only to the destination port using MAC address tables). If this network used proper switches, data would only go to the intended recipient, making both physical and logical topology star. This is why hubs are obsolete - they create collision domains and poor performance despite star physical topology.\"\n}, {\n  id: 11,\n  question: \"A manufacturing company wants to connect their warehouse security cameras to the main office network. They have 15 cameras that all need to send video feeds back to a central recording server in the office. The cameras are positioned throughout the warehouse and will all connect wirelessly to a single high-power access point mounted in the center of the warehouse ceiling. What topology best describes this wireless network design?\",\n  options: [\"Point-to-point - direct connection between office and warehouse\", \"Point-to-multipoint - one central access point connecting to multiple cameras\", \"Mesh - cameras interconnecting wirelessly for redundancy\", \"Star - all cameras connecting to a central hub\"],\n  correct: 1,\n  explanation: \"This is a point-to-multipoint topology. The key indicators are: (1) one central device (the access point) communicating with multiple endpoints (15 cameras), (2) wireless connections (no physical star cables), (3) all remote devices communicate through the central point. Point-to-multipoint is commonly used in wireless networks, especially for connecting multiple remote locations to one central location. While this physically resembles a star topology (and could be called wireless star), point-to-multipoint is the more precise term in networking, especially for wireless deployments. Point-to-point is incorrect because it involves only two devices. Mesh is incorrect because the cameras don't connect to each other. Traditional star topology refers to wired connections with physical cables, though the concept is similar.\"\n}, {\n  id: 12,\n  question: \"During a network audit, a consultant discovers that a small office network was designed with the following characteristics: very inexpensive to install, uses minimal cabling, all computers share a single communication channel, and a single cable break brings down the entire network. The consultant recommends immediate replacement. What topology is currently in use, and why should it be replaced?\",\n  options: [\"Ring topology - token passing creates bottlenecks in modern high-speed networks\", \"Star topology - the central switch is a bottleneck for network traffic\", \"Mesh topology - too many connections create management complexity\", \"Bus topology - it's obsolete, has a single point of failure, and is extremely difficult to troubleshoot\"],\n  correct: 3,\n  explanation: \"This is bus topology, and it should be replaced because it's obsolete and problematic. The characteristics clearly indicate bus: (1) inexpensive with minimal cabling (single backbone cable), (2) all devices share a single channel (the backbone), and (3) any break brings down the entire network (single point of failure along the entire cable length). Bus topology was common in the 1980s-90s with coaxial Ethernet (10BASE2, 10BASE5) but is completely obsolete now. Problems include: difficult to troubleshoot (where's the break?), single point of failure, performance degradation as devices are added (collisions), limited cable length, and disruption when adding/removing devices. Modern star topology with switches solves all these problems: easy to troubleshoot, isolated failures, better performance, easy to expand, and uses standard twisted-pair cabling.\"\n}, {\n  id: 13,\n  question: \"A company is planning to connect four regional offices. The network architect proposes connecting Office A (headquarters) to all three other offices (B, C, and D), and also adding a direct connection between Office B and Office C for redundancy, as these two offices frequently exchange large amounts of data. Office D will only connect to headquarters. What type of mesh topology is this, and how many connections are required?\",\n  options: [\"Full mesh with 6 connections - every office connects to every other office\", \"Star mesh with 4 connections - all offices connect only to headquarters\", \"Partial mesh with 5 connections - provides redundancy where needed without full mesh cost\", \"Hybrid mesh with 8 connections - combining multiple topology types\"],\n  correct: 2,\n  explanation: \"This is a partial mesh topology with 5 connections. Let's count: (1) A-B, (2) A-C, (3) A-D, (4) B-C, and (5) that's it. Partial mesh provides strategic redundancy - the frequently communicating offices (B and C) have a direct connection, while all offices can reach each other through headquarters if needed. This is more cost-effective than full mesh, which would require 6 connections for 4 offices using n(n-1)/2 formula: 4(3)/2 = 6. The missing connection for full mesh would be C-D. Partial mesh is very common in real-world WAN designs because it balances redundancy, performance, and cost. It's not pure star (which would only be the 3 headquarters connections), and the connection count is not 8. Partial mesh is the practical choice for most multi-site organizations.\"\n}, {\n  id: 14,\n  question: \"A network administrator is explaining to management why the company's current network design is both cost-effective and reliable. The network has 500 computers across five floors, with each floor using star topology to connect computers to floor switches. The floor switches connect to two redundant core switches in the data center using multiple fiber links. The Internet connection has both a primary ISP and a backup ISP. How should the administrator describe this design?\",\n  options: [\"Pure star topology with a hierarchical design and redundant connections\", \"Full mesh topology providing complete redundancy at all network layers\", \"Bus topology with modern improvements and redundant pathways\", \"Hybrid topology combining star at the access layer with partial mesh in the core for redundancy\"],\n  correct: 3,\n  explanation: \"This is a hybrid topology combining multiple design approaches. The network uses: (1) star topology at the access layer (computers to floor switches - easy to manage, isolated failures), (2) partial mesh between floor switches and core switches (multiple fiber links provide redundancy without full mesh complexity), (3) redundancy at the core (two core switches), and (4) redundant WAN connections (dual ISPs). This is a textbook example of modern network design - using the right topology for each layer. Access layer needs star for simplicity, core layer needs partial mesh for redundancy. It's not pure star because of the mesh elements. It's not full mesh because that would require every switch to connect to every other switch (impractical and expensive). Bus topology doesn't fit at all. Hybrid topology is extremely common in real-world networks because different parts of the network have different requirements.\"\n}, {\n  id: 15,\n  question: \"An organization is experiencing network problems traced back to their physical network design. They discover that their legacy network uses a circular cable layout where each device has exactly two neighbors, and data passes through each device sequentially until reaching its destination. A token controls which device can transmit data at any given time. The network frequently goes down when devices malfunction or are powered off. What topology is this, and what is the modern solution?\",\n  options: [\"Bus topology - upgrade to mesh topology for multiple redundant paths\", \"Ring topology - replace with star topology using switches for better reliability and easier management\", \"Star topology - add more switches to reduce the load on central device\", \"Mesh topology - reduce connections to simplify network management\"],\n  correct: 1,\n  explanation: \"This is ring topology, and it should be replaced with modern star topology. The clear indicators of ring are: (1) circular layout, (2) each device has exactly two neighbors, (3) data passes through devices sequentially, (4) token-based access control (Token Ring protocol), and (5) device failures bring down the network. Ring topology was popular in the 1980s-90s (IBM Token Ring) but is now obsolete. Problems include: single point of failure anywhere in the ring, difficult to troubleshoot, disruption when adding/removing devices, and complexity. Modern solution: star topology with switches provides: isolated failures (one device dying doesn't affect others), easy troubleshooting (check switch and specific port), simple expansion (plug into available port), and better performance. Some ring concepts survive in dual-ring designs (FDDI, SONET) for telecommunications where one ring serves as backup, but traditional single-ring LANs are completely obsolete.\"\n}];\nexport default lesson2Quiz;","map":{"version":3,"names":["lesson2Quiz","id","question","options","correct","explanation"],"sources":["C:/Users/Owner/certifystack/src/data/courses/network-plus/quizzes/lesson-02-quiz.js"],"sourcesContent":["// ============================================\r\n// LESSON 2: Network Topologies & Types\r\n// ============================================\r\n// CompTIA Network+ N10-009\r\n// Domain: Networking Concepts (1.2)\r\n// Questions: 15 scenario-based questions\r\n\r\nexport const lesson2Quiz = [\r\n  {\r\n    id: 1,\r\n    question: \"A small business is experiencing network connectivity issues.

Star topology perfectly meets requirements 1-3: individual cable failures are isolated (only affects one computer), it's the easiest topology to troubleshoot (just check the central switch and the specific connection), and adding computers is simple (plug into available switch port). The single point of failure concern is addressed by using redundant switches with first-hop redundancy protocols (HSRP/VRRP) and link aggregation. Full mesh is impractical for 100 computers (would require 4,950 connections using n(n-1)/2 formula) and is expensive and complex. Bus topology is obsolete - it doesn't meet any of the requirements well and is very difficult to troubleshoot. Ring topology is also mostly obsolete and doesn't meet the easy management requirement.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 9,\r\n    question: \"A healthcare organization has three buildings on their campus. Building A (administration) connects to Building B (clinic) and Building C (hospital). Buildings B and C also have a direct connection between them for fast medical record transfers. If any single connection fails, all buildings can still communicate. How many connections would be needed to upgrade this to a full mesh topology?\",\r\n    options: [\r\n      \"1 - need one more connection to complete the mesh\",\r\n      \"3 - need to triple the existing connections\",\r\n      \"6 - need to add 3 more connections for full redundancy\",\r\n      \"0 - it's already full mesh with 3 connections\"\r\n    ],\r\n    correct: 3,\r\n    explanation: \"This is already a full mesh topology with 3 connections. For a full mesh with 3 buildings, the formula n(n-1)/2 gives us: 3(3-1)/2 = 3(2)/2 = 3 connections. The description confirms all three connections exist: A-B, A-C, and B-C. In full mesh, every device connects directly to every other device. Since the problem states 'if any single connection fails, all buildings can still communicate,' this confirms full mesh - each building has two connections, so losing one still leaves a path. With only 3 buildings, full mesh is practical and affordable. As the number of devices grows, full mesh becomes impractical (10 devices = 45 connections, 20 devices = 190 connections), which is why partial mesh is more common in larger networks.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 10,\r\n    question: \"A network technician is documenting the company's network design. She observes that the physical cabling shows all computers running cables to a central wiring closet where they connect to switches.

What is the relationship between physical and logical topology in this scenario?\",\r\n    options: [\r\n      \"Physical and logical topologies are both star because switches create star networks\",\r\n      \"Physical topology is bus, but logical topology is star due to switch intelligence\",\r\n      \"Physical topology is star, but logical topology behaves like bus due to hub usage or misconfiguration\",\r\n      \"Physical topology is mesh, but logical topology is star due to centralized routing\"\r\n    ],\r\n    correct: 2,\r\n    explanation: \"The physical topology is star (all cables run to a central point), but the logical topology behaves like bus (data broadcast to all devices). This scenario describes either: (1) use of hubs instead of switches (hubs physically create star topology but logically operate as bus, broadcasting all traffic to all ports), or (2) switches operating in hub mode or with a misconfiguration. This is an important concept - physical topology (how cables are arranged) can differ from logical topology (how data flows). Modern switched networks are physically star and logically star (switches intelligently forward frames only to the destination port using MAC address tables). If this network used proper switches, data would only go to the intended recipient, making both physical and logical topology star. This is why hubs are obsolete - they create collision domains and poor performance despite star physical topology.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 11,\r\n    question: \"A manufacturing company wants to connect their warehouse security cameras to the main office network. They have 15 cameras that all need to send video feeds back to a central recording server in the office.

The key indicators are: (1) one central device (the access point) communicating with multiple endpoints (15 cameras), (2) wireless connections (no physical star cables), (3) all remote devices communicate through the central point. Point-to-multipoint is commonly used in wireless networks, especially for connecting multiple remote locations to one central location. While this physically resembles a star topology (and could be called wireless star), point-to-multipoint is the more precise term in networking, especially for wireless deployments. Point-to-point is incorrect because it involves only two devices. Mesh is incorrect because the cameras don't connect to each other. Traditional star topology refers to wired connections with physical cables, though the concept is similar.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 12,\r\n    question: \"During a network audit, a consultant discovers that a small office network was designed with the following characteristics: very inexpensive to install, uses minimal cabling, all computers share a single communication channel, and a single cable break brings down the entire network.

The characteristics clearly indicate bus: (1) inexpensive with minimal cabling (single backbone cable), (2) all devices share a single channel (the backbone), and (3) any break brings down the entire network (single point of failure along the entire cable length). Bus topology was common in the 1980s-90s with coaxial Ethernet (10BASE2, 10BASE5) but is completely obsolete now. Problems include: difficult to troubleshoot (where's the break?), single point of failure, performance degradation as devices are added (collisions), limited cable length, and disruption when adding/removing devices. Modern star topology with switches solves all these problems: easy to troubleshoot, isolated failures, better performance, easy to expand, and uses standard twisted-pair cabling.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 13,\r\n    question: \"A company is planning to connect four regional offices.

Let's count: (1) A-B, (2) A-C, (3) A-D, (4) B-C, and (5) that's it. Partial mesh provides strategic redundancy - the frequently communicating offices (B and C) have a direct connection, while all offices can reach each other through headquarters if needed. This is more cost-effective than full mesh, which would require 6 connections for 4 offices using n(n-1)/2 formula: 4(3)/2 = 6. The missing connection for full mesh would be C-D. Partial mesh is very common in real-world WAN designs because it balances redundancy, performance, and cost.

The network uses: (1) star topology at the access layer (computers to floor switches - easy to manage, isolated failures), (2) partial mesh between floor switches and core switches (multiple fiber links provide redundancy without full mesh complexity), (3) redundancy at the core (two core switches), and (4) redundant WAN connections (dual ISPs). This is a textbook example of modern network design - using the right topology for each layer. Access layer needs star for simplicity, core layer needs partial mesh for redundancy. It's not pure star because of the mesh elements. It's not full mesh because that would require every switch to connect to every other switch (impractical and expensive).
