## Section 3: Reflection (5 min)

**Scenario 1:** A user's iPhone suddenly can't send or receive iMessages, but regular SMS works fine. The user hasn't changed any settings. What would you check?

**Scenario 2:** An Android phone restarts randomly several times a day. It's not overheating and happens during normal use. How would you diagnose this?

**Scenario 3:** After updating their phone's OS, a user reports several apps no longer work. One is a banking app, another is a game. What's likely happening and what are the options?

**Scenario 4:** A user's phone screen sometimes doesn't respond to touches, or registers phantom touches. The screen isn't cracked. What could cause this?
