The magic number also equals the total number of IP addresses (not usable hosts) in each subnet.\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 15,\r\n    question: \"You have network 192.168.100.0/24 and need to create subnets for 4 departments with 50 devices each. What subnet mask should you use?\",\r\n    options: [\r\n      \"/26 (255.255.255.192) - 4 subnets of 62 hosts\",\r\n      \"/25 (255.255.255.128) - 2 subnets of 126 hosts\",\r\n      \"/27 (255.255.255.224) - 8 subnets of 30 hosts\",\r\n      \"/28 (255.255.255.240) - 16 subnets of 14 hosts\"\r\n    ],\r\n    correct: 0,\r\n    explanation: \"/26 is the best choice. You need 4 subnets (borrow 2 bits) and at least 50 hosts per subnet. /26 creates exactly 4 subnets with 62 usable hosts each, meeting both requirements. /25 only creates 2 subnets (not enough). /27 creates 8 subnets but only 30 hosts each (not enough for 50 devices). /26 provides room for growth beyond 50 devices per department.\"\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n"],"mappings":"AAAA;;AAEA,OAAO,MAAMA,WAAW,GAAG,CACzB;EACEC,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,yFAAyF;EACnGC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,QAAQ,EACR,QAAQ,EACR,QAAQ,EACR,QAAQ,CACT;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,2DAA2D;EACrEC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,IAAI,EACJ,IAAI,EACJ,IAAI,EACJ,IAAI,CACL;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,gGAAgG;EAC1GC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,cAAc,EACd,cAAc,EACd,eAAe,EACf,eAAe,CAChB;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,2DAA2D;EACrEC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,cAAc,EACd,eAAe,EACf,eAAe,EACf,eAAe,CAChB;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,oFAAoF;EAC9FC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,4BAA4B,EAC5B,6BAA6B,EAC7B,6BAA6B,EAC7B,6BAA6B,CAC9B;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,iEAAiE;EAC3EC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,aAAa,EACb,cAAc,EACd,aAAa,EACb,aAAa,CACd;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,+EAA+E;EACzFC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,gBAAgB,EAChB,iBAAiB,EACjB,kBAAkB,EAClB,kBAAkB,CACnB;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,4DAA4D;EACtEC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,4CAA4C,EAC5C,oDAAoD,EACpD,+CAA+C,EAC/C,kDAAkD,CACnD;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,uFAAuF;EACjGC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,iBAAiB,EACjB,iBAAiB,EACjB,kBAAkB,EAClB,kBAAkB,CACnB;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,QAAQ,EAAE,+DAA+D;EACzEC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,0EAA0E,EAC1E,0EAA0E,EAC1E,oDAAoD,EACpD,2CAA2C,CAC5C;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,QAAQ,EAAE,iEAAiE;EAC3EC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,YAAY,EACZ,YAAY,EACZ,YAAY,EACZ,YAAY,CACb;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,QAAQ,EAAE,4GAA4G;EACtHC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,yCAAyC,EACzC,kEAAkE,EAClE,gEAAgE,EAChE,oDAAoD,CACrD;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,QAAQ,EAAE,gFAAgF;EAC1FC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,eAAe,EACf,iBAAiB,EACjB,iBAAiB,EACjB,iBAAiB,CAClB;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,QAAQ,EAAE,0EAA0E;EACpFC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,wEAAwE,EACxE,wDAAwD,EACxD,oDAAoD,EACpD,2DAA2D,CAC5D;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,QAAQ,EAAE,uIAAuI;EACjJC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,+CAA+C,EAC/C,gDAAgD,EAChD,+CAA+C,EAC/C,gDAAgD,CACjD;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,CACF","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
