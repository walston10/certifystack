## üé® Part 4: Design Challenge - Multi-Office IP Scheme

TechCorp is expanding and needs an IP addressing plan for three new offices:

**Requirements:**
- **Headquarters:** Needs 500 device addresses (servers, desktops, printers, phones)
- **Branch Office 1:** Needs 100 device addresses
- **Branch Office 2:** Needs 50 device addresses
- All three offices should use private addressing
- Each office should have a separate IP range (not overlapping)

**Your Task:**
Design an IP addressing scheme for all three offices using private IP addresses.

**Deliverable:** Create a table like this:

| Office | IP Network Range | Private Range Used | Rationale |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| HQ | | (Class A/B/C?) | |
| Branch 1 | | (Class A/B/C?) | |
| Branch 2 | | (Class A/B/C?) | |

**Considerations:**
- Should you use the same private range class for all offices, or mix them?
- How do you ensure no overlap?
- What about future growth?
- Which private range (10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x, or 192.168.x.x) is best for each?

**Bonus Challenge:** Explain how these three offices could communicate with each other if they're connected via VPN tunnels.

<summary>Part 3: Troubleshooting Answers - Expand to Check</summary>

**Ticket #1:**
1. APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) - 169.254.x.x range
2. The computer cannot reach the DHCP server
3. Check: Is DHCP server running? Is network cable connected? Is there connectivity to DHCP server?
4. Yes, the user can communicate with other devices that also have APIPA addresses on the same physical segment

**Ticket #2:**
1. No! Private Class B is only 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255
2. 172.32.x.x is a public address, not in the private range
3. Use an IP in the 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 range (e.g., 172.16.15.10)

**Ticket #3:**
1. No - guests would be on the same network as corporate users
2. Use a different private range: 192.168.x.x or 172.16.x.x
3. Examples: 192.168.200.0/24, 192.168.guest.0/24, or 172.16.100.0/24

**Ticket #4:**
1. TCP/IP stack is working (software is fine)
2. Physical network connectivity issue or gateway is down
3. Next steps: Ping default gateway (192.168.1.1), check cable connection, verify network adapter has link light, try pinging another local device

<summary>Part 4: Design Challenge - Sample Solution</summary>

**Recommended Solution:**

| Office | IP Network Range | Private Range | Rationale |
|--------|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| HQ | 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.1.255 | Class A Private | Needs 500 addresses; using 10.0.0.0/23 gives 510 usable hosts with room for growth |
| Branch 1 | 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255 | Class C Private | Needs 100 addresses; 192.168.1.0/24 gives 254 hosts |
| Branch 2 | 192.168.2.0 - 192.168.2.255 | Class C Private | Needs 50 addresses; 192.168.2.0/24 gives 254 hosts with room for growth |

**Why this design:**
- No overlap between offices
- Each range has room for growth
- Uses different private ranges for easier management
- HQ uses Class A for scalability
- Branches use Class C for simplicity

**VPN Communication:** All three offices can communicate via site-to-site VPN tunnels. The router at each location connects to the other offices' routers, creating a private "intranet."
