## Section 3: Reflection Scenarios (5 min)

**Scenario 1:** An executive asks why you need formal policies when "everyone knows what to do." How do you justify the need for documented policies and procedures?

_________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________

**Scenario 2:** Your company just failed a compliance audit due to lack of evidence, even though you believe the controls were in place. What went wrong, and how do you prevent this in the future?

_________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________

**Scenario 3:** A new law requires specific security controls that conflict with your current business practices. Management wants to ignore it because "the government won't audit us." How do you respond?
