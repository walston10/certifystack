## Section 1: Concept Check (5 min)

Answer these questions in your own words:

1. **What's the difference between a USB hub and a powered USB hub? When would you need a powered hub?**

2. **A user's wireless mouse works fine on their desktop but constantly disconnects on their laptop. Both use USB receivers. What could cause this and how would you troubleshoot?**
