  {
    id: 6,
    front: "What is tailgating (piggybacking)?",
    back: "Unauthorized person following authorized person through secure door. Physical social engineering. May ask to 'hold door' or follow closely behind. Prevention: one-person-one-scan policy, mantraps, security awareness, challenge unknown persons politely."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    front: "What is shoulder surfing?",
    back: "Observing someone entering passwords, PINs, or viewing confidential information. Look over shoulder in public places - coffee shops, airports, ATMs. Prevention: privacy screens, position screen away from view, shield PIN entry, awareness of surroundings."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    front: "What is dumpster diving?",
    back: "Searching through trash for confidential information - documents, sticky notes with passwords, printouts, discarded drives. Physical attack for reconnaissance. Prevention: shred all documents (crosscut 7+), secure disposal of electronics, locked dumpsters, clean desk policy."

  {
    id: 9,
    front: "What is impersonation in social engineering?",
    back: "Pretending to be someone else - IT support, executive, vendor, authority figure. Builds trust to manipulate victim. Phone, email, or in-person. Request passwords, access, confidential info. Verify identity through known channels before complying."
  },
  {

    front: "What is pretexting?",
    back: "Creating fabricated scenario (pretext) to gain information or access. Attacker creates believable story. Example: 'IT doing security audit, need your password,' or 'vendor needs access for equipment repair.' Research victim first for credibility. Verify through official channels."

  {
    id: 11,
    front: "What are common social engineering tactics?",
    back: "Authority (impersonate boss/police), urgency ('act now!'), intimidation (threats/consequences), familiarity (pretend to know you), trust (friendly, helpful), scarcity ('limited time offer'), consensus ('everyone's doing it'). Exploit human psychology, not technical vulnerabilities."
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    front: "What is the urgency tactic in social engineering?",
    back: "Creating false sense of urgency to pressure quick action without thinking. 'Account will be closed,' 'Act in 24 hours,' 'Immediate action required.' Bypasses critical thinking. Prevention: slow down, verify independently, no legitimate organization creates artificial urgency."
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    front: "What is the authority tactic in social engineering?",
    back: "Impersonating or claiming authority - CEO, IT department, law enforcement, IRS. People tend to comply with authority figures. Example: 'This is the CEO, I need you to...' Verify through known contact methods, not phone numbers/emails provided by caller."

  },
  {
    id: 16,
    front: "How do you verify suspicious links before clicking?",
    back: "Hover over link (don't click) to see actual URL, look for misspellings in domain (paypa1.com vs paypal.com), check for HTTPS, compare to known legitimate URL, go directly to site via browser instead, use link checker tools. When in doubt, don't click."
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    front: "What should you do with suspicious emails?",
    back: "Don't click links or download attachments, don't reply, verify sender through separate channel (phone, known email), report to IT/security team, delete email, mark as phishing/spam. If clicked link - run antivirus, change passwords, report to IT."
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    front: "What is a watering hole attack?",

  },
  {
    id: 23,
    front: "What policies help prevent social engineering?",
    back: "Clean desk policy (lock documents), visitor badges/escorts, verify identity before sharing info, callback verification for requests, dual approval for financial transactions, secure disposal procedures, incident reporting process, access control enforcement."

  {
    id: 27,
    front: "What makes social engineering attacks effective?",
    back: "Exploit human psychology not technical flaws, create emotional responses (fear, urgency, curiosity), appear legitimate/authoritative, research victims for credibility, humans want to be helpful/compliant, easier than hacking systems."

  {
    id: 28,
    front: "What is the difference between phishing and spear phishing?",

  {
    id: 29,
    front: "What credential harvesting techniques exist?",
    back: "Fake login pages (cloned websites), phishing emails requesting passwords, keyloggers, shoulder surfing, password reset scams, malicious Wi-Fi hotspots, fake tech support. Prevention: MFA, password managers, verify URLs, security awareness."
