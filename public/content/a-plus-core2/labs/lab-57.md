## Section 3: Reflection (5 min)

**Scenario 1:** An employee brings software from home to install on their work computer. They say they "own" the software. What issues might this create?

**Scenario 2:** Your company is audited by a software vendor and they find 50 installations but only 40 licenses purchased. What happens next?

**Scenario 3:** A startup wants to use open source software as the foundation for their commercial product. What licensing considerations must they evaluate?

**Scenario 4:** A user asks you to install a "cracked" version of expensive software because "the company won't buy it." How do you respond?
