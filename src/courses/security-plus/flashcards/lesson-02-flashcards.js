    front: "What is a threat actor?",
    back: "Any entity that poses a threat to an organization's security. Can be individuals, groups, or nation-states with varying motivations and capabilities."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    front: "What are Nation-state actors?",
    back: "Government-sponsored attackers with extensive resources and sophisticated capabilities. Often conduct APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats) for espionage or disruption."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    front: "What is an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)?",
    back: "A prolonged, targeted attack typically by nation-states. Characterized by stealth, persistence, and specific objectives like espionage or infrastructure disruption."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    front: "What are Unskilled attackers (script kiddies)?",
    back: "Attackers with limited technical knowledge who use existing tools and scripts created by others. Low sophistication but can still cause damage."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    front: "What are Hacktivists?",
    back: "Attackers motivated by political or social causes. Use hacking to promote their agenda, often through website defacement, DDoS, or data leaks."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    front: "What is an Insider threat?",
    back: "A threat from within the organization - employees, contractors, or partners. Can be malicious (intentional) or negligent (accidental)."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    front: "What is Organized crime in cybersecurity?",
    back: "Criminal groups motivated by financial gain. Well-funded, professional operations focusing on ransomware, fraud, data theft, and selling stolen data."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    front: "What is Shadow IT?",
    back: "Unauthorized systems, software, or services used within an organization without IT approval. Creates security blind spots and compliance risks."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    front: "What's the difference between internal and external threat actors?",
    back: "Internal = inside the organization (employees, contractors). External = outside (hackers, nation-states, competitors). Internal threats bypass perimeter defenses."
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    front: "What are the key attributes used to classify threat actors?",
    back: "Internal vs external, resources/funding level, and level of sophistication. These determine their capabilities and likely attack methods."
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    front: "Which threat actor typically has the most resources and funding?",
    back: "Nation-state actors. They have government backing, unlimited budgets, and can develop zero-day exploits and custom malware."
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    front: "Which threat actor has the lowest level of sophistication?",
    back: "Unskilled attackers (script kiddies). They rely on pre-made tools and lack deep technical understanding."
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    front: "What is data exfiltration as a motivation?",
    back: "Stealing sensitive data to sell, leak, or use for competitive advantage. Common motivation for nation-states (espionage) and organized crime."
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    front: "What is financial gain as a threat motivation?",
    back: "Attacking for money through ransomware, fraud, theft, or selling stolen data. Primary motivation for organized crime groups."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    front: "What is espionage as a threat motivation?",
    back: "Gathering intelligence on governments, military, or corporations. Typically nation-state actors seeking trade secrets or political information."
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    front: "What is service disruption as a motivation?",
    back: "Causing downtime or outages to harm operations. May be for extortion, competitive advantage, or political statement (hacktivism)."
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    front: "What motivates hacktivists?",
    back: "Philosophical or political beliefs. They hack to promote causes, expose wrongdoing, or punish organizations they disagree with."
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    front: "What is revenge as a threat motivation?",
    back: "Attacking to retaliate for perceived wrongs. Common with disgruntled employees or former employees who feel mistreated."
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    front: "What is ethical hacking motivation?",
    back: "White hat hackers and bug bounty hunters who find vulnerabilities to help organizations improve security. Motivated by recognition and rewards."
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    front: "What is an attack vector?",
    back: "The path or method an attacker uses to gain access to a target. Examples: email, network, physical access, supply chain."
  },
  {
    id: 21,
    front: "What is direct access as an attack vector?",
    back: "Physical or logical access to systems without going through intermediaries. Includes stolen credentials, physical break-ins, or insider access."
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    front: "What is email/phishing as an attack vector?",
    back: "Using malicious emails to deliver malware or steal credentials. Most common initial attack vector for organizations."
  },
  {
    id: 23,
    front: "What is a supply chain attack vector?",
    back: "Compromising a vendor, supplier, or third-party software to attack their customers. Example: SolarWinds attack compromised thousands of organizations."
  },
  {
    id: 24,
    front: "What is social media as an attack vector?",
    back: "Using social platforms for reconnaissance, social engineering, or spreading malware. Attackers gather information or build trust before attacking."
  },
  {
    id: 25,
    front: "What is removable media as an attack vector?",
    back: "Using USB drives, external hard drives, or other portable media to introduce malware. Can bypass network security controls."
  },
  {
    id: 26,
    front: "What is cloud services as an attack vector?",
    back: "Exploiting misconfigured cloud resources, stolen cloud credentials, or vulnerable cloud applications to gain access."

  {
    id: 30,
    front: "Why are insider threats particularly dangerous?",
    back: "They already have authorized access, know internal systems, and bypass perimeter security. Harder to detect than external attacks."
