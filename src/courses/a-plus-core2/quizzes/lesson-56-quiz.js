    question: "While repairing a customer's computer, a technician discovers files containing child exploitation material. What should the technician do FIRST?",
    options: [
      "Delete the files and continue working",
      "Immediately stop work, do not alter evidence, report to supervisor/law enforcement following company protocol",
      "Copy the files for further investigation",
      "Confront the customer directly"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Upon discovering illegal content (child exploitation, evidence of crimes): immediately stop work, do NOT touch/delete/modify anything (preserves evidence), report to immediate supervisor, follow company incident response procedures (typically involves law enforcement), document what was seen without viewing further. NEVER delete evidence. Don't copy files (potentially illegal). Don't confront customer (safety risk, could destroy evidence). This is a mandatory reporting situation in most jurisdictions. Tampering with evidence can make you liable. Follow established protocols. Your company should have clear procedures for this scenario. Child safety takes absolute priority."

    question: "A technician finds a large folder labeled 'Downloaded Movies' with hundreds of pirated films and software on a customer's computer. What should they do?",
    options: [
      "Report it to the FBI immediately",
      "Inform the customer that pirated software is illegal and recommend removal, but complete the requested service",
      "Copy the movies for personal use",
      "Delete everything without telling the customer"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "For pirated content (software, media): inform customer it's illegal and could expose them to malware/legal action, recommend removal, document that you advised the customer, complete requested service unless company policy prohibits. Pirated software is different from child exploitation - not mandatory law enforcement reporting (unless company policy requires). Don't copy pirated material (makes you liable). Don't delete customer files without permission. Don't report directly to FBI for copyright violations (civil matter, not your jurisdiction). Your role: advise customer of risks, document advisement, follow company policy. Customer relationship continues but with proper legal warning."

    question: "A technician accidentally views sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) including Social Security numbers and credit card data on a customer's computer. What is their responsibility?",
    options: [
      "Share the information with coworkers",
      "Maintain strict confidentiality, avoid viewing further, never disclose what was seen",
      "Use the credit card information for online purchases",
      "Post about it on social media without names"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "When accessing PII accidentally: immediately look away/close files, maintain absolute confidentiality, never disclose what was seen, don't access unnecessary personal information, follow data privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA if applicable). Sharing PII violates privacy laws and ethical standards. Using information is theft and fraud. Social media posts (even anonymous) violate confidentiality. Technicians have privileged access - abuse destroys trust and careers. PII must be protected like you'd want yours protected. Violations can result in: termination, lawsuits, criminal charges, massive fines. Privacy is foundational to customer trust."

    question: "What is the purpose of maintaining a 'chain of custody' when handling potential evidence of illegal activity?",
    options: [
      "Chain of custody has no purpose",
      "To document who handled evidence, when, and what was done - ensures evidence integrity for legal proceedings",
      "To hide evidence from authorities",
      "To share evidence with everyone"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Chain of custody documents: who collected evidence, when it was collected, who has handled it, what was done to it, how it was stored/secured. This proves evidence wasn't tampered with, making it admissible in court. Document: date/time, who discovered it, who has access, how it's secured, when transferred to authorities. Break in chain of custody can make evidence inadmissible. Don't hide evidence (obstruction of justice). Don't share evidence (compromises investigation). Proper documentation protects legal case. If you discover evidence: minimize handling, document everything, secure it, transfer to proper authorities following protocol. Professional handling preserves justice."

    question: "A customer asks a technician to help bypass software license restrictions or activate pirated software. How should the technician respond?",
    options: [
      "Help them bypass the restrictions - customer is always right",
      "Politely decline: 'I cannot assist with bypassing license restrictions. I can help you obtain legitimate licenses or find free alternatives.'",
      "Report the customer to software companies",
      "Charge extra to do it"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "When asked to facilitate illegal activity: politely but firmly decline, explain it's illegal and against professional ethics, offer legitimate alternatives (purchase licenses, use open-source alternatives, contact vendor for licensing help). Don't assist with piracy (makes you liable, violates terms of service, potentially illegal). Customer requests don't override law/ethics. Don't report customer for asking (unless company policy requires). Don't profit from illegal activity. Your professional integrity isn't for sale. Offer legal solutions. Most customers accept refusal when explained professionally. Maintain ethical boundaries regardless of customer pressure."

    question: "A technician discovers evidence suggesting potential workplace violence threats (weapons, threatening documents) on an employee's work computer. What should they do?",
    options: [
      "Ignore it - not their problem",
      "Immediately report to supervisor/security/HR following company protocol - potential safety threat",
      "Confront the employee about the threats",
      "Post about it on social media to warn people"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Workplace violence threats require immediate reporting: notify supervisor, security, HR, or designated safety personnel, follow company threat assessment protocols, document what was found without further investigation, preserve evidence. Ignoring potential violence threats endangers people. Don't confront (safety risk, destroys evidence). Don't post publicly (violates confidentiality, compromises investigation). Threats must be assessed by qualified professionals (HR, security, law enforcement). False alarms are better than missed warnings. Most companies have clear escalation procedures. Your responsibility is reporting - not investigation or confrontation. Safety trumps privacy concerns."

    question: "After discovering prohibited content, a technician is unsure whether to report it to law enforcement or just their supervisor. What should they do?",
    options: [
      "Make their own decision without consulting anyone",
      "Follow company incident response policy and report to immediate supervisor who will escalate appropriately",
      "Call law enforcement directly without telling their company",
      "Do nothing and hope someone else finds it"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Follow established company protocols: report to immediate supervisor/manager first, let company's legal/security teams handle law enforcement notification, document discovery and reporting, preserve evidence. Companies have legal teams and protocols for law enforcement interaction. Direct reporting might compromise investigations or violate protocols. Don't make unilateral decisions about evidence. Doing nothing is negligent. Your company likely has: incident response plans, legal counsel, law enforcement contacts, chain of command. Follow it. Supervisor escalates based on severity and legal requirements. This protects you, the company, and ensures proper handling. Always follow protocol over personal judgment."

    question: "A technician's company policy states they must report certain types of content to authorities, but the customer is a long-time friend. What should the technician do?",
    options: [
      "Warn the friend and delete the evidence",
      "Follow company policy and legal obligations regardless of personal relationships - report as required",
      "Pretend they never saw anything",
      "Help the friend hide the evidence better"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Professional obligations override personal relationships: follow policy and law regardless of who the customer is, maintain professional boundaries, document and report as required, recognize that helping conceal crimes makes you an accomplice. Warning friends destroys evidence (obstruction). Pretending ignorance is lying. Helping hide evidence is criminal. Your professional license, career, and freedom aren't worth protecting someone breaking the law. True friends don't put you in positions requiring you to violate law/ethics. If you can't be objective, recuse yourself and have someone else handle it. Professional integrity isn't selective based on relationships."

    question: "When documenting an incident involving prohibited content, what information should be recorded?",
    options: [
      "Nothing - don't document anything",
      "Date/time of discovery, what was found (general description), actions taken, who was notified, how evidence was preserved",
      "Only your personal opinions about the customer",
      "Detailed viewing of all prohibited content for thorough documentation"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Incident documentation should include: date/time of discovery, general description of what was found (without viewing extensively), exact location of files, actions taken, who was notified and when, how evidence was preserved, any witnesses. Be factual, objective, and concise. Don't include opinions/judgments. Don't extensively view content (unnecessary, potentially traumatic, could be illegal). Don't fail to document (weakens evidence chain). Good documentation: supports legal proceedings, protects you from liability, demonstrates proper procedures followed, provides timeline for investigation. Write reports as if they'll be read in court - they might be."

    question: "A healthcare organization's computer contains protected health information (PHI) under HIPAA. The technician needs to access the system for repairs. What are their obligations?",
    options: [
      "Access and share any patient information freely",
      "Access only what's necessary for the repair, maintain strict confidentiality, follow HIPAA security procedures",
      "Post interesting medical cases on social media",
      "Tell friends and family about patients' medical conditions"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "HIPAA obligations for technicians: access minimum necessary information only (for repair purposes), maintain complete confidentiality, follow organizational security policies, never disclose PHI, secure devices properly, report any breaches. Sharing PHI violates HIPAA (massive fines, criminal penalties). Social media posts violate confidentiality. Discussing patients' information is illegal. Even though you're not medical staff, HIPAA applies to anyone with access to PHI. Organizations must have Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with IT providers. Training is required. Violations carry severe penalties: up to $50,000 per violation, potential jail time. Treat medical information with absolute confidentiality."

    question: "A technician finds evidence of financial fraud (fraudulent invoices, embezzlement documents) on a corporate employee's computer. What should they do?",
    options: [
      "Blackmail the employee for money",
      "Report to supervisor/management/corporate security following company protocol",
      "Help the employee hide the evidence for a cut of the money",
      "Ignore it - financial crimes aren't the IT department's concern"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Financial fraud discovery: report to supervisor, management, corporate security, or compliance department, follow company escalation procedures, preserve evidence, document findings. Blackmail is a serious crime. Helping conceal fraud makes you an accomplice. Ignoring fraud when discovered may make you liable (especially in regulated industries). Financial crimes can destroy companies and harm innocent employees. Your duty is reporting to appropriate channels. Company has: audit teams, legal counsel, fraud investigation resources. They handle investigation and law enforcement notification. Don't investigate yourself. Report up the chain and let experts handle it."

    question: "A technician is asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before working on a company's systems. What does this mean for their obligations?",
    options: [
      "NDAs are meaningless and can be ignored",
      "They are legally bound to keep company information confidential and cannot disclose what they see/learn",
      "They can share information with friends but not strangers",
      "NDAs only apply during work hours"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "NDA obligations: legally binding contract to maintain confidentiality, covers information learned during work, applies indefinitely (or per terms specified), violations can result in lawsuits and damages. Cannot share: trade secrets, proprietary information, business strategies, customer lists, technical details, anything marked confidential. Exceptions: typically allows disclosure for illegal activity reporting. NDAs protect business interests. Violating NDAs: damages professional reputation, results in lawsuits, ends business relationships. Read NDAs carefully before signing. Confidentiality is fundamental to professional services. Information learned at work stays confidential - friends, family, social media aren't exempt. NDAs apply 24/7, not just work hours."

    question: "A financial services company requires technicians to undergo background checks before accessing their systems. Why is this important?",
    options: [
      "It's just bureaucracy with no real purpose",
      "To verify trustworthiness and identify potential security risks before granting access to sensitive financial data",
      "To discriminate against job applicants",
      "Background checks are illegal"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Background checks for sensitive access: verify identity, check criminal history (especially financial crimes, fraud), confirm credentials, assess security risk, comply with regulations (SOX, PCI-DSS, GLBA require vetting). Financial institutions handle: money, PII, account information, investment data. Background checks protect: customer data, financial assets, company reputation, regulatory compliance. This isn't discrimination - it's due diligence. Background checks are legal and required in many industries. Refusing background checks disqualifies you from sensitive work. If you have concerning history, be honest - concealment is worse than disclosure. Proper vetting protects everyone."

    question: "A technician is working remotely on a customer's computer and notices illegal content. Does working remotely change their reporting obligations?",
    options: [
      "Yes - remote work means no reporting obligations",
      "No - reporting obligations remain the same regardless of work location",
      "Remote workers can ignore everything they see",
      "Only on-site workers have obligations"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Location doesn't change obligations: remote access to illegal content requires same reporting as in-person discovery, follow same incident response procedures, preserve evidence, document findings, report through proper channels. Remote work doesn't create legal exemptions. Same professional and legal standards apply. Remote access often creates: detailed logs (good for evidence), jurisdictional questions (consult legal team), additional documentation requirements. Your professional responsibilities don't depend on physical location. Virtual presence carries same obligations as physical presence. Remote support doesn't mean reduced responsibility."

    question: "After properly reporting prohibited content through company channels, can the technician discuss the incident with their spouse or friends?",
    options: [
      "Yes - they can tell anyone now that it's reported",
      "No - maintain confidentiality even after reporting; discuss only with authorized personnel",
      "Only immediate family can be told",
      "Post about it on social media without names"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Confidentiality continues after reporting: discuss only with authorized personnel (supervisor, legal team, investigators), don't tell family/friends/coworkers not involved, never post publicly (even anonymized), ongoing investigation requires secrecy. Discussing investigations: compromises cases, violates confidentiality, could obstruct justice, breaches professional ethics. Information is 'need to know' - spouse doesn't need to know. Even after cases conclude, maintain confidentiality (reputation, privacy). Authorized personnel will specify if/when you can discuss. If you need emotional support after traumatic discoveries, seek counseling (who are bound by confidentiality) rather than discussing details with friends. Confidentiality has no expiration date."
