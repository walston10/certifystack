Before CIDR (pre-1993), networks were stuck with /8 (Class A), /16 (Class B), or /24 (Class C). If you needed 500 hosts, you had to use a /16 with 65,534 addresses, wasting 65,034 IPs. CIDR allows any prefix length (/1 to /32), so you can use /23 (510 hosts) for much more efficient allocation.\"\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n"],"mappings":"AAAA,OAAO,MAAMA,WAAW,GAAG,CACzB;EACEC,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,+CAA+C;EACzDC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,iBAAiB,EACjB,iBAAiB,EACjB,iBAAiB,EACjB,iBAAiB,CAClB;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,6CAA6C;EACvDC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,iBAAiB,EACjB,iBAAiB,EACjB,kBAAkB,EAClB,kBAAkB,CACnB;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,4DAA4D;EACtEC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,KAAK,EACL,KAAK,EACL,KAAK,EACL,KAAK,CACN;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,+DAA+D;EACzEC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,aAAa,EACb,aAAa,EACb,eAAe,EACf,eAAe,CAChB;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,qDAAqD;EAC/DC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,qFAAqF,EACrF,mDAAmD,EACnD,mCAAmC,EACnC,iCAAiC,CAClC;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,iEAAiE;EAC3EC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,6BAA6B,EAC7B,6BAA6B,EAC7B,6BAA6B,EAC7B,6BAA6B,CAC9B;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,6DAA6D;EACvEC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,YAAY,EACZ,YAAY,EACZ,YAAY,EACZ,cAAc,CACf;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,8DAA8D;EACxEC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,2CAA2C,EAC3C,wBAAwB,EACxB,2CAA2C,EAC3C,iDAAiD,CAClD;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,QAAQ,EAAE,oFAAoF;EAC9FC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,qBAAqB,EACrB,uBAAuB,EACvB,uBAAuB,EACvB,uBAAuB,CACxB;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,QAAQ,EAAE,0CAA0C;EACpDC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,aAAa,EACb,aAAa,EACb,aAAa,EACb,cAAc,CACf;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,QAAQ,EAAE,qDAAqD;EAC/DC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,sCAAsC,EACtC,6DAA6D,EAC7D,2CAA2C,EAC3C,yCAAyC,CAC1C;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,QAAQ,EAAE,2DAA2D;EACrEC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,KAAK,EACL,KAAK,EACL,KAAK,EACL,KAAK,CACN;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,QAAQ,EAAE,kFAAkF;EAC5FC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,IAAI,EACJ,IAAI,EACJ,IAAI,EACJ,KAAK,CACN;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,QAAQ,EAAE,6CAA6C;EACvDC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,mFAAmF,EACnF,oDAAoD,EACpD,uCAAuC,EACvC,+CAA+C,CAChD;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,EACD;EACEJ,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,QAAQ,EAAE,+CAA+C;EACzDC,OAAO,EAAE,CACP,yCAAyC,EACzC,8BAA8B,EAC9B,+DAA+D,EAC/D,2BAA2B,CAC5B;EACDC,OAAO,EAAE,CAAC;EACVC,WAAW,EAAE;AACf,CAAC,CACF","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
