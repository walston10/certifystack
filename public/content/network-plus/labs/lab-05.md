   Gateway (.1):     ____________________
   DHCP Range:       ____________________ to ____________________
   Static Range:     ____________________ to ____________________
   Broadcast:        ____________________

Floor 2 (Engineering):
   Subnet:           ____________________
   Gateway:          ____________________
   DHCP Range:       ____________________ to ____________________
   Static Range:     ____________________ to ____________________
   Broadcast:        ____________________

## üåê Part 5: Multi-Site Branch Office Design

**Scenario:** GlobalTech has 3 branch offices that need connectivity.

**Given Network:** 172.16.50.0/24  
**Requirements:**
- **Branch A (Denver):** 60 devices
- **Branch B (Austin):** 60 devices
- **Branch C (Seattle):** 60 devices
- **WAN Links:** 3 point-to-point connections between offices

### Design Challenge:

You need to create:
- 3 branch office subnets (60 devices each)
- 3 point-to-point WAN subnets (2 hosts each)

**Can you fit this all in a single /24?**

### Your Analysis:

**Branch Subnets:**
- How many hosts needed per branch? ________
- What CIDR provides this? ________
- How many of these subnets fit in a /24? ________

**WAN Subnets:**
- How many hosts per WAN link? ________
- What CIDR provides this? ________
- How many /30 subnets fit in remaining space? ________

### Your Proposed Solution:

**Option 1: Try to fit everything**
- Branches use ________ subnets
- WAN links use ________ subnets
- Does it fit? ________ (show math)

**Option 2: Use separate /24 networks (if Option 1 doesn't fit)**
- Branches: 172.16.50.0/24
- WAN links: 172.16.51.0/24

Which option did you choose and why?

## üö® Part 6: Find and Fix Subnetting Errors

GlobalTech hired a junior admin who made several subnetting mistakes. Find and fix them!

### Error Scenario 1: Overlapping Subnets

**Claim:** "I divided 192.168.5.0/24 into 4 subnets"

**Their Subnet Table:**
| Subnet | Network | Broadcast |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| 1      | .0      | .64       |
| 2      | .64     | .128      |
| 3      | .128    | .192      |
| 4      | .192    | .256      |

**Your Analysis:**
- What's wrong with this table?
- What should the broadcast addresses actually be?
- What mistake did they make?

---

### Error Scenario 2: Wrong Subnet Mask

**Claim:** "I created 8 subnets from 10.10.10.0/24 using /26"

**Your Analysis:**
- How many subnets does /26 actually create?
- What CIDR should they use for 8 subnets?
- What's the correct subnet mask?

---

### Error Scenario 3: Invalid Host Assignment

**Network:** 172.16.20.0/27

**Assigned IPs:**
- Server A: 172.16.20.0
- Server B: 172.16.20.31
- Workstation: 172.16.20.15

**Your Analysis:**
- Which IPs are invalid for hosts?
- Why are they invalid?
- What should they be changed to?

---

### Error Scenario 4: Insufficient Hosts

**Requirement:** "We need 40 devices per subnet"  
**Implementation:** "I used /27 which provides 30 hosts"

**Your Analysis:**
- Is /27 sufficient?
- What's the minimum CIDR needed for 40 devices?
- Calculate usable hosts for your recommendation.

**Floor 4:** 192.168.10.192/26 (.193-.254, broadcast .255)

<summary>Part 6: Error Corrections - Expand for Answers</summary>

**Error 1:** Broadcasts should be .63, .127, .191, .255 (not .64, .128, .192, .256)

**Error 2:** /26 creates 4 subnets, not 8. Need /27 for 8 subnets.

**Error 3:** .0 is network (use .1+), .31 is broadcast (use .30 or less)

**Error 4:** /27 = 30 hosts (insufficient). Need /26 (62 hosts) for 40 devices.

## üöÄ Speed Goals

**Target times for exam readiness:**

| Task | Beginner | Intermediate | Expert |
|------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Magic number calculation | 10 sec | 5 sec | 2 sec |
| Divide /24 into 4 subnets | 5 min | 3 min | 90 sec |
| Divide /24 into 8 subnets | 8 min | 5 min | 2 min |
| IP to subnet mapping | 30 sec | 15 sec | 5 sec |

**Practice Strategy:**
- Do 5 problems per day
- Time yourself
- Track improvement
- Aim for "Intermediate" before exam day

## üéØ What You've Accomplished

By completing this lab, you've:

‚úÖ Mastered the Magic Number method  
‚úÖ Practiced dividing networks into 2, 4, 8, and 16 subnets  
‚úÖ Learned to map IP addresses to their subnets  
‚úÖ Designed real multi-floor and multi-site networks  
‚úÖ Identified and corrected common subnetting mistakes  
‚úÖ Built speed and confidence for the exam

**You're now ready for Lesson 6: Advanced Subnetting & VLSM!**

This lab solidified your equal-sized subnetting skills. In the next lesson, we'll learn Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)‚Äîthe technique that lets you create subnets of different sizes for maximum efficiency.

**Outstanding work! üéâ**
