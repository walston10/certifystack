## Section 3: Reflection (5 min)

**Scenario 1:** While imaging a computer for a new employee, you discover the previous user left behind files that appear to be confidential HR documents about other employees. What do you do?

**Scenario 2:** A user calls saying they clicked a link in an email and now their screen shows a ransomware message demanding Bitcoin. What are your immediate steps?

**Scenario 3:** During routine maintenance, you discover an employee has been using company resources to run a side business. This isn't illegal, but violates company policy. How do you handle it?

**Scenario 4:** You're asked to provide a forensic image of an employee's computer for a legal investigation. What precautions must you take?
