  },
  {
    id: 7,
    front: "What is battery memory effect?",
    back: "A phenomenon where batteries lose maximum capacity if repeatedly recharged before fully discharging. Modern Li-ion and Li-poly batteries do NOT suffer from this."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    front: "What are three key battery maintenance best practices?",
    back: "Avoid extreme temperatures - Keep battery between 20-80% charge when possible - Perform full discharge/charge cycles occasionally to calibrate battery meter."

  {
    id: 9,
    front: "What is the difference between a docking station and a port replicator?",
    back: "Docking station: Full-featured, often includes additional drives, expansion slots, and charges laptop. Port replicator: Simple device that only provides additional ports without expansion or charging."
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    front: "What is the purpose of Function (Fn) keys on laptops?",
    back: "Provide access to secondary functions like screen brightness, volume, Wi-Fi toggle, and other hardware controls without dedicated buttons."
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    front: "What is a touchpad (trackpad)?",
    back: "A touch-sensitive surface below the keyboard used for cursor control. Most common pointing device on laptops, supports gestures like two-finger scrolling."
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    front: "What is a pointing stick (TrackPoint)?",
    back: "A small rubber nub between keyboard keys (often red) used for cursor control. Common on ThinkPad laptops. Allows cursor control without moving hands from keyboard."
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    front: "Why do laptops use SO-DIMM RAM instead of standard DIMM?",
    back: "SO-DIMM (Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module) is about half the size of desktop DIMM RAM, allowing it to fit in the compact laptop form factor."
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    front: "What type of storage drives are commonly found in modern laptops?",
    back: "2.5-inch SATA SSDs or HDDs - M.2 NVMe SSDs (fastest) - Some older laptops may have 1.8-inch drives."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    front: "Where are Wi-Fi antennas typically located in a laptop?",
    back: "Usually located in the display/screen bezel area at the top of the laptop for optimal signal reception."
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    front: "What is a laptop inverter and when is it needed?",
    back: "A component that converts DC power to AC power for CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp) backlights in older LCD displays. Not needed in modern LED-backlit displays."
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    front: "What is the difference between LCD and LED displays?",
    back: "LCD uses liquid crystals but needs a backlight. LED is actually LCD with LED backlighting (not CCFL). LED displays are thinner, more energy-efficient, and brighter."
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    front: "What does OLED stand for and what is its advantage?",
    back: "Organic Light Emitting Diode. Each pixel produces its own light (no backlight needed), resulting in perfect blacks, better contrast, and thinner displays."
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    front: "What is a digitizer in laptop displays?",
    back: "A layer that detects touch or stylus input on the screen. Required for touchscreen functionality and active stylus support."
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    front: "What connector types are used for laptop display cables internally?",
    back: "LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signaling) in older laptops - eDP (Embedded DisplayPort) in modern laptops. These connect the motherboard to the display panel."
  },
  {
    id: 21,

  },
  {
    id: 24,
    front: "What common issue causes laptop keyboard failure?",
    back: "Liquid spills - Worn out keys from heavy use - Ribbon cable damage - Failed keyboard controller. Entire keyboard assembly usually needs replacement."
  },
  {
    id: 25,
    front: "What is a DC jack and why does it commonly fail?",
    back: "The power input port where the charger plugs into the laptop. Commonly fails due to physical stress from cable movement, causing intermittent charging or no power."
