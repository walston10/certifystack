    question: "A technician arrives at a customer's home to repair a computer. The customer's house is messy with items scattered around. How should the technician respond?",
    options: [
      "Make comments about the messy house and suggest cleaning tips",
      "Maintain professionalism, avoid judgmental comments, and focus on the technical work",
      "Refuse to work until the house is cleaned",
      "Post photos of the messy house on social media"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Maintain professionalism regardless of customer's environment: avoid judgmental comments or observations about personal matters, respect customer's property and privacy, focus solely on the technical issue, be courteous and non-judgmental. Making comments about the home is unprofessional and disrespectful. Refusing work (unless actual safety hazard) is inappropriate. NEVER post customer information or photos on social media - violates privacy and professionalism. Treat all customers with respect regardless of their circumstances. Your job is technical support, not lifestyle consulting."

    question: "During troubleshooting, a customer repeatedly asks, 'How much longer will this take?' The technician is unsure. What is the BEST response?",
    options: [
      "'I don't know, stop asking me!'",
      "'I'm working as quickly as possible. I'll need approximately [realistic estimate] more minutes, and I'll keep you updated on progress.'",
      "Ignore the customer completely",
      "'It takes as long as it takes'"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Provide realistic estimates and regular updates: give honest timeframe (avoid overpromising), explain what you're doing, provide progress updates, set realistic expectations. If unsure, give a range and explain why ('I need to run diagnostics which could take 15-30 minutes'). Rude responses damage customer relationships. Ignoring customers creates anxiety. Vague responses frustrate customers. Communication and expectation management are critical to customer satisfaction. It's better to overestimate and finish early than underestimate and disappoint. Keep customers informed - silence creates worry."

    question: "A technician discovers the customer's problem was caused by their own mistake (deleted important system files). How should the technician communicate this?",
    options: [
      "'You really messed up your computer. This is your fault.'",
      "Explain the issue tactfully without blaming: 'It appears some system files were removed. Let me restore them and show you how to avoid this in the future.'",
      "Laugh at the customer's mistake",
      "Charge triple the normal rate as punishment"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Never blame or shame customers: explain issues tactfully and constructively, focus on solutions rather than fault, offer education to prevent recurrence, maintain empathy (everyone makes mistakes). Blaming customers damages relationships and makes them defensive. Laughing is extremely unprofessional. Punitive pricing is unethical. Even when customer caused the problem, remain professional and helpful. Use incidents as teaching moments. Customers remember how you made them feel, not just technical competence. Professionalism means treating people with respect even when they make errors."

    question: "A customer becomes angry and raises their voice, saying the technician's company always breaks things. The customer is upset about a previous unrelated incident. How should the technician respond?",
    options: [
      "Argue back and defend the company loudly",
      "Remain calm, listen actively, acknowledge their frustration, and focus on resolving the current issue professionally",
      "Walk out immediately",
      "Tell the customer they're overreacting"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Dealing with upset customers: remain calm (don't match their emotional level), listen actively without interrupting, acknowledge their feelings ('I understand you're frustrated'), apologize for their experience, focus on solving current problem, avoid being defensive. Don't argue - it escalates conflict. Walking out abandons the customer (unless threatened/abused). Telling customers their feelings are invalid makes things worse. Angry customers often just want to be heard and have problems solved. De-escalate through empathy, active listening, and solution focus. Professional composure under pressure is a key skill."

    question: "While working on a customer's computer, the technician notices personal files with embarrassing content. What should they do?",
    options: [
      "Tell coworkers about what they saw",
      "Respect customer privacy, avoid looking at personal files, and never disclose what was seen",
      "Make jokes about it with the customer",
      "Post about it on social media (without names)"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Respect customer privacy absolutely: avoid viewing personal files unless necessary for repair, never disclose what you see on customer computers, maintain confidentiality, treat all customer information as private. Sharing customer information with coworkers (gossip) violates privacy. Making jokes is unprofessional and embarrassing. Posting on social media (even anonymously) is unethical and potentially illegal. Customers trust technicians with access to personal information - honor that trust. Confidentiality is fundamental to professionalism. Violating privacy can result in termination, lawsuits, and criminal charges. Privacy is non-negotiable."

    question: "A technician is running late to an appointment due to traffic. What should they do?",
    options: [
      "Just show up late without notifying the customer",
      "Call or message the customer as soon as possible to inform them of the delay and provide a new estimated arrival time",
      "Skip the appointment entirely",
      "Blame the customer for living in a bad location"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "When running late: notify customer immediately (call, text, email), provide realistic new ETA, apologize for the inconvenience, offer to reschedule if delay is significant. Showing up late without notice is disrespectful of customer's time. Skipping appointments is unprofessional. Blaming customers is inappropriate. Communication prevents frustration - customers can adjust plans if informed. Silence creates uncertainty and anger. Punctuality demonstrates respect. When delays are unavoidable, prompt communication maintains trust. Being late happens; not communicating about it is the real problem. Professional courtesy requires timely updates."

    question: "A technician doesn't know the answer to a customer's technical question. What is the BEST response?",
    options: [
      "Make up an answer to appear knowledgeable",
      "Admit uncertainty: 'I'm not certain about that. Let me research it and get back to you with accurate information.'",
      "Tell the customer to figure it out themselves",
      "Pretend the question was never asked"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "When you don't know: admit it honestly, commit to finding the answer, research and follow up, never guess or make up information. Making up answers destroys credibility when proven wrong. Telling customers to figure it out is unprofessional. Ignoring questions is dismissive. Customers respect honesty more than false confidence. Incorrect information can cause harm. It's better to say 'I don't know but I'll find out' than provide wrong answers. Follow up promptly with researched information. Admitting knowledge gaps shows integrity. No one knows everything - how you handle gaps matters."

    question: "After repairing a computer, what should the technician do before leaving the customer?",
    options: [
      "Leave immediately without explanation",
      "Demonstrate the fix, verify customer satisfaction, provide documentation, explain what was done and any follow-up needed",
      "Just send an invoice",
      "Tell the customer to call if it breaks again"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Proper service closure: demonstrate the repair works, verify customer understands and is satisfied, explain what was wrong and what you did, provide documentation (invoice, warranty info, notes), offer to answer questions, explain preventive measures or follow-up needed, thank the customer. Leaving abruptly seems dismissive. Invoice-only communication is impersonal. 'Call if it breaks' doesn't instill confidence. Thorough closure ensures customer understanding, satisfaction, and trust. Follow-up communication shows professionalism. Document work for records. Customer satisfaction at departure determines if they'll use you again and recommend you. Complete the service relationship properly."

    question: "A customer uses non-technical language to describe a problem: 'My computer is being weird and doing the spinny thing.' How should the technician respond?",
    options: [
      "'Stop using such stupid descriptions'",
      "Use active listening: 'I understand it's running slowly. Let me investigate what's causing the delay.' Translate to technical terms internally.",
      "Mock their technical knowledge",
      "Use highly technical jargon to confuse them more"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Communicate effectively with non-technical users: listen actively to their descriptions, translate their language to technical concepts, avoid jargon in responses, use analogies and simple terms, be patient with imprecise descriptions. Never mock or belittle customers' technical knowledge. Using complex jargon alienates customers. 'Spinny thing' likely means loading cursor/slow performance - understand intent. Adapt communication to audience. Technical competence includes explaining concepts clearly to non-experts. Make customers feel heard and understood. Clear communication prevents misunderstandings and builds rapport. Your job includes translation between user and computer."

    question: "A technician arrives at a business and the receptionist asks them to wait. The technician needs to use the restroom. What should they do?",
    options: [
      "Walk around the building looking for a restroom without asking",
      "Ask politely: 'May I use your restroom while I wait?'",
      "Use a plant in the lobby",
      "Complain loudly about poor hospitality"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Professional behavior on customer premises: ask permission before using facilities, respect customer's property and space, follow their security/access rules, wait in designated areas, identify yourself clearly. Walking around unauthorized areas is inappropriate and may violate security. Inappropriate bathroom use is unacceptable. Complaining is unprofessional. Polite requests are appropriate - most businesses accommodate service providers. Respect boundaries. Follow customer's rules and procedures. You're a guest on their property. Professional courtesy and respect for their space maintains good relationships. When in doubt, ask."

    question: "A customer offers the technician a beverage while working. What is the appropriate response?",
    options: [
      "Accept and set the drink directly on the computer equipment",
      "Politely accept or decline as appropriate: 'Thank you, I'd appreciate that' or 'No thank you, but I appreciate the offer.'",
      "Demand expensive beverages",
      "Ignore the offer completely"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Accepting hospitality appropriately: politely accept or decline based on preference and situation, express gratitude regardless, if accepting, place drinks away from equipment, be mindful of customer's generosity. Setting drinks on equipment risks damage. Demanding specific items is entitled and rude. Ignoring offers is rude. Small courtesies build rapport. If declining, be gracious ('Thank you, but I just had coffee'). Never abuse hospitality. Keep work area clean. Courtesy in small interactions reflects overall professionalism. Accept generosity graciously without expectation or entitlement."

    question: "During a repair, the technician realizes they need a part that will take 2 days to arrive. The customer was expecting same-day completion. How should this be communicated?",
    options: [
      "Don't tell the customer - just disappear for 2 days",
      "Explain clearly: 'I've diagnosed the issue and need to order a part. It will arrive in 2 days. I can complete the repair then.' Offer options if available.",
      "Blame the customer for having old equipment",
      "Install a wrong part just to finish quickly"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Managing changed expectations: explain situation clearly and promptly, provide accurate timeline, apologize for the delay, offer options (loaner equipment, alternative solutions, different service levels), keep customer informed of progress. Disappearing creates anxiety and damages trust. Blaming customers is unprofessional. Using wrong parts creates bigger problems. Honesty and communication maintain trust despite setbacks. Customers appreciate transparency over false promises. Update expectations proactively. Offer alternatives when possible. Delays happen - how you handle communication determines customer satisfaction. Clear, honest communication builds trust even when delivering bad news."

    question: "A technician strongly disagrees with a customer's choice to use a Mac instead of Windows. The customer asks for help with their Mac. How should the technician respond?",
    options: [
      "Lecture the customer about why Windows is superior and refuse to help",
      "Provide professional assistance regardless of personal preferences: 'I'd be happy to help with your Mac.'",
      "Sabotage the Mac to prove Windows is better",
      "Only help if they promise to switch to Windows"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Professional service means: separating personal preferences from professional duties, serving customers' needs (not pushing your preferences), respecting customer choices, providing quality service regardless of technology platform. Refusing service based on preference is unprofessional. Sabotage is unethical and illegal. Conditional service is inappropriate. Your job is helping customers with THEIR technology choices, not converting them to yours. Personal opinions have no place in customer service. Support the customer's ecosystem professionally. If you can't service a platform, refer them to someone who can - don't lecture them. Customer's choice deserves respect."

    question: "A technician receives a very positive review from a satisfied customer praising their work. What is the appropriate response?",
    options: [
      "Ignore it completely",
      "Thank the customer professionally: 'Thank you for your kind feedback. I'm glad I could help resolve your issue.'",
      "Demand a larger tip based on the review",
      "Become arrogant and stop trying"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Responding to positive feedback: express genuine gratitude, acknowledge the customer, remain humble, maintain professionalism, use it as motivation to maintain high standards. Ignoring appreciation is missed opportunity to strengthen relationship. Demanding more money is greedy and inappropriate. Arrogance alienates customers. Positive reviews are earned through consistent professionalism - appreciate them but don't let them create complacency. Thank customers for taking time to provide feedback. Good reviews attract new customers. Maintain the high standards that earned the praise. Gratitude and humility maintain professional reputation."

    question: "A technician completes a difficult repair and wants to share the experience. What is the appropriate way to discuss the work?",
    options: [
      "Post customer's name, photos, and details on social media",
      "Discuss technical aspects generally (for learning/sharing) without identifying customer information",
      "Email customer's information to all their friends",
      "Put customer's data in their public portfolio"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Sharing professional experiences appropriately: discuss technical challenges and solutions generically, remove all identifying information, obtain explicit permission if using any specifics, respect confidentiality always, use experiences for professional development/education. NEVER share customer names, photos, personal information, or identifiable details without explicit written consent. Social media posts violate privacy. Sharing customer data is unethical and often illegal. Generic discussions ('I encountered ransomware that encrypted files...') are acceptable. Specific cases ('John Smith's computer had...') violate privacy. Maintain confidentiality even when discussing interesting cases. Privacy protection is absolute professional responsibility."
