#### Activity H: Thermal Paste Replacement

**Goal:** Practice proper thermal paste application.

> ⚠️ Only do this if you removed the heatsink. Once removed, old paste MUST be replaced.

**Materials needed:**
- Isopropyl alcohol (90% or higher)
- Lint-free cloth or coffee filter
- New thermal paste
- Plastic applicator or card (optional)

**Step 1: Remove old thermal paste**

1. Apply isopropyl alcohol to cloth
2. Gently wipe CPU surface until clean
3. Clean heatsink contact surface the same way
4. Allow to dry completely (1-2 minutes)

**Step 2: Apply new thermal paste**

**Method: Pea/dot method (recommended for beginners)**

1. Apply a small pea-sized dot in center of CPU
2. Do NOT spread it - the heatsink pressure will do this
3. Mount heatsink directly on top
4. Secure screws in order (usually numbered, or diagonal pattern)
5. Tighten evenly - half turn each screw, rotating between them

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- [ ] Too much paste (overflow, insulates instead of conducts)
- [ ] Too little paste (incomplete coverage)
- [ ] Spreading paste (can introduce air bubbles)
- [ ] Uneven heatsink pressure (overtightening one side)

---

2. [ ] Wi-Fi card - antennas reconnected correctly
3. [ ] Storage drive(s) - screws secured
4. [ ] RAM - clicked into place
5. [ ] Battery - reconnected
6. [ ] Bottom cover - all clips engaged
7. [ ] Screws - in correct locations

**Before closing the bottom cover:**
