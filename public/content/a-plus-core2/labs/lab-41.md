# Lab 41: Physical Security Controls

**Tier:** 1  
**Time:** 25-35 minutes  
**Exam Objectives:** 2.1 - Summarize various security measures and their purposes

---

## Section 1: Concept Check (5 min)

1. What is a mantrap (access control vestibule), and why is it more secure than a single locked door?

2. List three types of biometric authentication. What are the advantages and disadvantages of biometrics vs. key cards?

3. What is the purpose of a Kensington lock, and what type of equipment is it designed to protect?

4. Explain the difference between a security guard and video surveillance (CCTV). When would you use each?

5. What is "tailgating" in physical security, and how can organizations prevent it?

## Section 2: Hands-On Activities

### Tier 1 Activities (Required)
> ✅ **Conceptual learning** - Security assessment and planning exercises.

#### Activity A: Physical Security Assessment

**Goal:** Evaluate physical security measures in a real or hypothetical environment.

**Assess your current location (home, office, school, or library):**

| Security Layer | Present? | Type/Description |
|----------------|----------|------------------|
| Perimeter (fencing, gates) | | |
| Building access (locks, cards) | | |
| Interior doors/zones | | |
| Video surveillance | | |
| Alarm system | | |
| Security personnel | | |
| Visitor management | | |

**Rate the overall physical security (1-5):** _______________

**Biggest vulnerability identified:** _______________

---

#### Activity B: Access Control Methods

**Goal:** Understand different access control technologies.

**Compare access control methods:**

| Method | How It Works | Pros | Cons |
|--------|--------------|------|------|
| Traditional key | | | |
| PIN/keypad | | | |
| Key card (proximity) | | | |
| Key fob (RFID) | | | |
| Smart card | | | |
| Biometric (fingerprint) | | | |
| Biometric (facial) | | | |
| Biometric (retina/iris) | | | |
| Mobile credential | | | |

**Multi-factor physical access example:**

Design a two-factor physical access system:

| Factor 1 (Something you have/know) | Factor 2 (Something you are/have) |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| | |

---

#### Activity C: Security Zones Design

**Goal:** Plan security zones for a facility.

**Scenario:** Design security zones for a small office building with:
- Public reception area
- Employee work areas
- Server room
- Executive offices
- Storage/supply room

**Complete the zone plan:**

| Zone | Access Level | Who Can Enter | Security Measures |
|------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Reception/Lobby | Public | | |
| Employee Area | | | |
| Server Room | | | |
| Executive Suite | | | |
| Storage Room | | | |

**Traffic flow considerations:**

How do visitors move through the building? _______________

Where are the chokepoints for access control? _______________

---

#### Activity D: Surveillance Planning

**Goal:** Plan a video surveillance system.

**Scenario:** You're adding CCTV to a retail store with:
- Main entrance
- Emergency exit (back)
- Cash register area

|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Main entrance | | | |
| Back exit | | | |
| Cash registers | | | |
| Storage room | | | |
| Parking lot | | | |

**System considerations:**

| Feature | Your Decision | Reason |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Recording: Local vs Cloud | | |

|-------|-------------------------------|
| Desktop computer | |
| Laptop in office | |
| Laptop while traveling | |
| Server in rack | |
| External hard drive | |
| USB drives | |
| Mobile phones | |
| Network switches | |

**Cable lock assessment:**

| Device Type | Has Security Slot? | Lock Compatible? |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Your laptop (if available) | | |
| Desktop monitor | | |
| Projector | | |

---

#### Activity F: Environmental Controls

**Goal:** Understand environmental security requirements.

**Data center environmental requirements:**

| Factor | Recommended Range | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Temperature | | |
| Humidity | | |
| Fire suppression type | | |
| Power backup (UPS) | | |
| Generator fuel | | |

**Environmental threats to consider:**

| Threat | Detection Method | Prevention/Mitigation |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| Fire | | |
| Flood | | |
| Power loss | | |
| HVAC failure | | |
| Unauthorized access | | |

---

#### Activity G: Secure Disposal

**Goal:** Understand proper disposal of sensitive equipment and data.

**Match disposal method to item:**

| Item | Disposal Method | Why This Method? |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| Paper documents (sensitive) | | |
| Hard drive (HDD) | | |
| SSD | | |
| USB flash drive | | |
| Old laptop | | |
| CD/DVD with data | | |
| Old badge/key card | | |
| Backup tapes | | |

**Disposal verification:**

| Method | Verification Process |
|--------|---------------------|
| Shredding | |
| Degaussing | |
| Physical destruction | |
| Secure wipe | |

---

## Section 3: Reflection (5 min)

**Scenario 1:** An employee holds the door open for someone carrying boxes who says they forgot their badge. What policy should be in place, and how should the employee respond?

**Scenario 2:** A company has expensive laptops on desks in an open office. Cleaning staff come in after hours. What physical security measures would you recommend?

**Scenario 3:** A server room uses only a PIN code for access. The same PIN has been used for 3 years. What are the security risks, and what improvements would you suggest?

**Scenario 4:** After a break-in, video surveillance shows the intruder but their face isn't identifiable. What went wrong, and how would you improve the system?
