    question: "A security analyst is troubleshooting why users are receiving browser warnings when visiting the company’s intranet site. The URL starts with https:// but uses port 80 in the firewall configuration. Which port should be opened instead to ensure proper encrypted communication?",
    options: [
      "80",
      "443",
      "8080",
      "8443"
    ],
    answerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "HTTPS uses port 443 for encrypted web traffic via TLS/SSL. Port 80 is used for unencrypted HTTP, so using it would cause certificate and encryption errors."
  },
  {
    question: "An administrator needs to securely log into a Linux server from a remote workstation over the internet. Which protocol and port combination should be used to protect credentials and session data during transmission?",
    options: [
      "Telnet on port 23",
      "FTP on port 21",
      "SSH on port 22",
      "SMTP on port 25"
    ],
    answerIndex: 2,
    explanation: "SSH (Secure Shell) uses port 22 and provides encrypted command-line and file-transfer sessions, replacing Telnet’s insecure plaintext communication."
  },
  {
    question: "A technician is configuring a legacy FTP server. They notice two ports are in use: one for sending commands like USER and LIST, and another for actual file transfers. Which correctly identifies the purpose of each?",
    options: [
      "Port 20 is secure, port 21 is not",
      "Port 20 is for data transfer, port 21 is for control commands",
      "Port 20 handles uploads, port 21 handles downloads",
      "They're interchangeable"
    ],
    answerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "FTP uses port 21 for control commands (login, directory navigation) and port 20 for the data connection (file transfer). This dual-port design separates command and data channels."
  },
  {
    question: "During a network audit, a technician needs to identify which port ranges are reserved for system-level or well-known services like HTTP and DNS. Which range is correct?",
    options: [

      "49152-65535",
      "1-65535"
    ],
    answerIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Well-known ports (0–1023) are assigned to standardized services like HTTP (80) and DNS (53). Registered ports (1024–49151) and dynamic ports (49152–65535) are used for other applications and client sessions."
  },
  {
    question: "A user reports that typing a web address like 'www.example.com' doesn’t work, but entering the IP address directly does. The technician suspects a DNS issue. Which port should be checked for proper operation on the DNS server?",
    options: [
      "25",
      "53",
      "80",
      "143"
    ],
    answerIndex: 1,
    explanation: "DNS uses port 53 for both UDP (queries) and TCP (zone transfers). If blocked, domain names can’t resolve to IP addresses."
  },
  {

      "IMAP on port 143",
      "POP3 on port 110",
      "IMAPS on port 993"
    ],
    answerIndex: 2,
    explanation: "POP3 on port 110 downloads and typically removes emails from the server. IMAP keeps emails stored on the server for access from multiple devices."
  },
  {
    question: "A company’s mail relay is failing to send messages to external domains. The firewall administrator confirms that the necessary outbound mail port is blocked. Which port should be opened to restore normal delivery?",

      "25",
      "110",
      "143",
      "465"
    ],
    answerIndex: 0,

  },
  {
    question: "A network admin captures DNS traffic and observes both UDP and TCP packets destined for port 53. Why would DNS use both transport protocols?",
    options: [
      "TCP only",
      "UDP only",
      "Both TCP and UDP",
      "ICMP"
    ],
    answerIndex: 2,
    explanation: "DNS uses UDP for quick queries and TCP for larger data transfers (e.g., zone transfers). Both operate on port 53."
