    id: 1,
    front: "What is the difference between LCD, LED, and OLED displays?",
    back: "LCD uses liquid crystals with external backlight - LED is LCD with LED backlight (not CCFL) - OLED pixels emit their own light, no backlight needed, perfect blacks."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    front: "What does CCFL stand for and where is it used?",
    back: "Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp. Older backlight technology for LCD screens. Requires an inverter to convert DC to AC power. Largely replaced by LED backlights."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    front: "What is the purpose of an inverter in laptop displays?",
    back: "Converts DC power from the motherboard to AC power required by CCFL backlights. Only needed in older laptops with CCFL-backlit displays, not LED displays."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    front: "What are common symptoms of inverter failure?",
    back: "Dim display that's barely visible - Display works fine with external monitor - Screen flickers - Display brightness not adjustable. The LCD panel itself is fine."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    front: "What is display resolution?",
    back: "The number of pixels horizontally and vertically. Examples: 1920x1080 (Full HD), 2560x1440 (QHD), 3840x2160 (4K UHD). Higher resolution = sharper image."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    front: "What does aspect ratio mean and what are common ratios?",

  },
  {
    id: 7,
    front: "What is a digitizer in a touchscreen display?",

  },
  {
    id: 8,
    front: "What is the difference between capacitive and resistive touchscreens?",

  },
  {
    id: 9,
    front: "Where are Wi-Fi antennas typically located in laptops and why?",
    back: "In the display bezel/hinge area at the top of the screen. This location provides optimal signal reception when the laptop is open and keeps antennas away from interference."
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    front: "What is LVDS and where is it used?",
    back: "Low Voltage Differential Signaling. A display cable standard used in older laptops to connect the motherboard to the LCD panel. Carries video signal through a ribbon cable."
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    front: "What is eDP and how does it differ from LVDS?",
    back: "Embedded DisplayPort. Modern display cable standard that replaced LVDS. Uses fewer wires, supports higher resolutions and refresh rates, and is more power-efficient."
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    front: "What are common causes of a dim laptop display?",
    back: "Failed backlight (CCFL or LED) - Failed inverter (CCFL displays) - Brightness settings too low - Faulty display cable - Power management settings."
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    front: "What does it mean if a laptop display works with an external monitor but not the built-in screen?",
    back: "The GPU is working fine. Problem is likely: failed backlight, bad inverter, damaged display cable, or faulty LCD panel itself."
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    front: "What are dead pixels and stuck pixels?",
    back: "Dead pixel: Completely black, not receiving power. Stuck pixel: Displays wrong color (often red/green/blue), transistor stuck in one state. Stuck pixels can sometimes be fixed."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    front: "What external display connection types are common on laptops?",
    back: "HDMI (most common, audio + video) - DisplayPort/Mini DisplayPort - USB-C/Thunderbolt (video + data + power) - VGA (legacy, analog) - DVI (legacy, digital)."
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    front: "What is the maximum resolution supported by HDMI 1.4, 2.0, and 2.1?",
    back: "HDMI 1.4: 4K@30Hz - HDMI 2.0: 4K@60Hz - HDMI 2.1: 8K@60Hz or 4K@120Hz. Newer versions support higher bandwidth and refresh rates."
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    front: "What advantages does DisplayPort have over HDMI?",
    back: "Higher bandwidth for better resolution/refresh rates - Supports daisy-chaining multiple monitors - Royalty-free standard - Better for gaming (adaptive sync)."
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    front: "What is USB-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode?",
    back: "Allows USB-C ports to carry DisplayPort video signal alongside data and power. Enables single-cable connection for video, data, and charging."
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    front: "What causes vertical or horizontal lines on a laptop display?",
    back: "Damaged display cable (most common) - Failing LCD panel - GPU issues - Pressure on screen. Try external monitor to isolate GPU vs display problem."
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    front: "What is ghosting or image persistence on displays?",

  },
  {
    id: 25,
    front: "What is the difference between matte and glossy laptop displays?",
    back: "Matte (anti-glare): Reduces reflections, better for bright environments, slightly less vibrant. Glossy: More vibrant colors, deeper blacks, but shows reflections and glare."
  },
  {
    id: 26,
    front: "What is a privacy screen or privacy filter?",
    back: "A physical or built-in screen overlay that limits viewing angles, making the display only visible from directly in front. Prevents shoulder surfing in public spaces."
