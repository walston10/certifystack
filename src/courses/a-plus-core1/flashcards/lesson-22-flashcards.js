    id: 2,
    front: "What is the difference between ROM, R, and RW optical discs?",
    back: "ROM (Read-Only Memory): Pre-recorded, factory pressed, cannot be written (CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, BD-ROM). R (Recordable): Write once, cannot erase (CD-R, DVD-R, BD-R). RW (ReWritable): Can write, erase, rewrite multiple times (CD-RW, DVD-RW, BD-RE)."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    front: "What is the difference between DVD-R and DVD+R?",
    back: "Two competing formats. DVD-R: Official DVD Forum standard. DVD+R: DVD+RW Alliance format. Functionally equivalent for users. Modern drives support both (DVD±R). Plus format slightly better error handling. Minus more compatible with older players. Use either."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    front: "What are CD-R and CD-RW used for?",
    back: "CD-R: Burn music CDs, archives, data backups (once). CD-RW: Rewritable, temporary storage, testing burns. 700 MB capacity both. Slow write speeds (8x-52x). Mostly obsolete - replaced by USB drives. Still used for audio CDs in cars."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    front: "What are DVD types and their uses?",
    back: "DVD-ROM: Movies, software, read-only. DVD-R/+R: Backup data, home videos, write once. DVD-RW/+RW: Rewritable backup, temporary storage. DVD-DL: Dual-layer, 8.5 GB (movies). Largely replaced by streaming and cloud storage."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    front: "What is Blu-ray and what formats exist?",
    back: "High-definition optical disc. BD-ROM: Movies, games (PlayStation), read-only. BD-R: Write once, 25/50 GB. BD-RE: Rewritable. 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray: 66-100 GB. Requires Blu-ray drive (won't work in DVD drive). Expensive drives/media."
  },
  {

    front: "What connections do optical drives use?",
    back: "Internal: SATA (current standard), IDE/PATA (legacy, obsolete). External: USB 2.0/3.0, USB-C. 5.25-inch drive bay for internal. External portable drives common. Most modern cases lack 5.25\" bays. External more versatile."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    front: "What optical drive speeds mean (e.g., 24x)?",
    back: "Multiplier of base speed. CD: 1x = 150 KB/s (24x = 3.6 MB/s). DVD: 1x = 1.32 MB/s (16x = 21 MB/s). Blu-ray: 1x = 4.5 MB/s (12x = 54 MB/s). Higher number = faster read/write. Different speeds for read/write/rewrite."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    front: "Why are optical drives becoming obsolete?",
    back: "Digital distribution (Steam, streaming). Cloud storage. USB drives faster/cheaper/more convenient. Smaller form factor PCs (no 5.25\" bay). Software downloads vs physical media. Blu-ray still used for movies/games but declining. USB optical drives available if needed."

  },
  {
    id: 14,
    front: "What is the difference between SD and microSD?",
    back: "Physical size: SD (32x24mm) vs microSD (15x11mm). Same technology otherwise. microSD uses adapter to fit SD slots. microSD more versatile - can use in SD devices with adapter. SD directly in cameras/card readers. Speed capabilities identical."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    front: "What is a USB flash drive?",
    back: "Portable storage using flash memory. Connects via USB. Capacities: 8 GB-1 TB common. Speeds vary widely (20-500 MB/s). USB 2.0/3.0/3.1/3.2. Also called thumb drive, pen drive, USB stick. Convenient for file transfer, portable apps, bootable media."

    id: 19,
    front: "What is eSATA and is it still used?",
    back: "External SATA. 6 Gbps like internal SATA. Hot-swappable. Requires eSATA port (rare on modern systems). Doesn't provide power - drive needs separate adapter. Faster than USB 2.0 but slower than USB 3.0. Largely obsolete - replaced by USB 3.0+."
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    front: "What optical disc burning software is commonly used?",
    back: "Windows built-in: Basic burning. ImgBurn: Free, ISO images. Nero Burning ROM: Professional (paid). CDBurnerXP: Free. Brasero (Linux). iTunes/Windows Media Player: Audio CDs. Most users use built-in OS tools now. Creating bootable USB more common than burning discs."
  },
  {
    id: 21,
    front: "What is disc finalization and when is it needed?",
    back: "Makes disc readable in other devices after burning. CD-R/DVD-R: Must finalize for compatibility. Multisession discs: Can add data without finalizing until done. If not finalized: only readable in drive that burned it. RW discs: Different process. Modern software often auto-finalizes."
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    front: "What is a multisession disc?",
    back: "Optical disc that can be written multiple times without finalizing. Add files over time until full. Each session creates new TOC (Table of Contents). CD-R/DVD-R support multisession. Wastes some space per session. Less common now. Finalize when done adding data."
  },
  {
    id: 23,
    front: "What file systems are used on optical discs?",

  },
  {
    id: 24,
    front: "What is the write-protect switch on SD cards?",
    back: "Physical lock switch on side of SD card (not microSD). Prevents writing/deleting data. Purely mechanical switch read by device. If locked: can't format, write, or delete. Common issue: accidentally enabled. Not available on microSD cards."
  },
  {
    id: 25,
    front: "What causes optical disc read errors?",
    back: "Scratches on data surface. Dirty/fingerprints. Disc degradation over time. Incompatible formats. Failed drive laser. Poor quality media. Copy protection. Wrong disc type in drive (Blu-ray in DVD drive). Clean with microfiber cloth (center to edge)."
  },
  {
    id: 26,
    front: "How do you clean optical discs properly?",
    back: "Use microfiber cloth. Wipe from center straight out to edge (NOT circular). Avoid paper towels (scratches). Use disc cleaning solution or water only. Don't use household cleaners. Let dry completely. Prevent scratches - handle by edges. Deep scratches unfixable."
  },
  {
    id: 27,
    front: "What is the lifespan of optical media?",
    back: "Manufacturer claims: 25-100+ years. Reality varies greatly. Quality matters: professional media lasts longer. Storage conditions critical: cool, dry, dark, vertical storage. CD-R dye degrades: 5-10 years typical. DVD/Blu-ray more stable. Don't rely on optical for long-term backup. Verify periodically."
  },
  {
    id: 28,
    front: "What is disc rot?",
    back: "Degradation of optical disc over time. Causes: poor manufacturing, storage conditions, adhesive breakdown. Symptoms: read errors, data loss, disc appears cloudy/spotted. Can affect even unopened discs. More common with cheap media. Why optical not ideal for archival. No fix once started."
  },
  {
    id: 29,
    front: "What USB flash drive features should you consider?",
    back: "Capacity (actual needs, not max). Speed (USB 3.0+ for large files). Durability (metal vs plastic). Water resistance. Encryption support. Dual connectors (USB-A and USB-C). Brand reputation. Warranty. Keychain attachment. Retractable vs cap. Price per GB."
  },
  {
    id: 30,
    front: "What are common SD card issues and solutions?",
    back: "Card not recognized: Clean contacts, try different reader, check format. Write protection: Check lock switch. Slow performance: Wrong speed class, fragmentation, cheap card. Corruption: Don't remove during write, use 'Safely Remove'. Format in device that will use it. Fake capacity: Test with H2testw."
