    id: 1,
    front: "What are the main types of software licenses?",
    back: "Open source (free, source code available, modifiable), Commercial/Proprietary (purchase required, closed source), Freeware (free but closed source), Shareware (trial period, then pay), Subscription (ongoing payment - Microsoft 365), Volume/Enterprise (bulk licensing for organizations)."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    front: "What is open source software?",
    back: "Software with freely available source code that can be modified and redistributed. Examples: Linux, LibreOffice, Firefox. Licenses vary (GPL, MIT, Apache). Benefits: free, customizable, community support. Must follow license terms (some require sharing modifications)."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    front: "What is commercial/proprietary software licensing?",
    back: "Software requiring purchase, closed source code, vendor controls distribution. Examples: Microsoft Windows, Adobe Photoshop, AutoCAD. License grants right to use, not ownership. Cannot modify, reverse engineer, or redistribute. Includes support typically."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    front: "What is a EULA (End User License Agreement)?",
    back: "Legal contract between software vendor and user. Defines: permitted uses, restrictions, warranty disclaimers, liability limits. Must accept to install/use software. Important terms: number of installations, transferability, support, updates. Read before accepting."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    front: "What is the difference between per-user and per-device licensing?",
    back: "Per-user: license tied to individual user, can use on multiple devices. Per-device: license tied to specific computer, anyone can use that computer. Per-user more flexible for multiple devices, per-device cheaper for shared computers. Choose based on usage pattern."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    front: "What is volume licensing?",
    back: "Bulk licensing for organizations buying many licenses. Discounted pricing, centralized management, flexible deployment. Examples: Microsoft Volume Licensing, Adobe VIP. Types: Open License, Enterprise Agreement. Requires minimum purchase quantity. Includes Software Assurance often."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    front: "What is a subscription-based license?",
    back: "Ongoing payment (monthly/annual) for software access. Examples: Microsoft 365, Adobe Creative Cloud, SaaS applications. Benefits: always current version, lower upfront cost, includes updates/support. Stop paying = lose access. Growing trend in software industry."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    front: "What is software activation and why is it required?",
    back: "Verification process confirming license is genuine before full functionality. Prevents piracy, ensures proper licensing, tracks installations. Methods: product key entry, online activation, phone activation. May need reactivation after major hardware changes."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    front: "What happens if you don't activate software?",
    back: "Limited functionality (reduced features), time limits (30-day grace period), watermarks on screen, periodic reminders, eventually may stop working. Windows shows activation watermark, restricts personalization. Must activate for full use."
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    front: "What is a product key and how should you handle it?",
    back: "Alphanumeric code proving license ownership. Typically 25 characters (Windows), varies by software. Store securely (don't share publicly), keep with purchase documentation, needed for reinstallation, one key per license usually. Lost key may require repurchase."
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    front: "What is Digital Rights Management (DRM)?",
    back: "Technology preventing unauthorized copying/use of digital content. Used in: software, music, movies, ebooks. Methods: activation requirements, online checks, copy protection. Controversial - limits legitimate use but protects copyright. Can prevent resale."
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    front: "What is the difference between freeware and open source?",
    back: "Freeware: free to use but closed source code, can't modify. Open source: free with available source code, can modify/redistribute per license terms. Examples - Freeware: WinRAR trial. Open source: 7-Zip. Open source more freedom."
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    front: "What is shareware licensing?",
    back: "Try before you buy model. Free trial period (15-30 days), then purchase required for continued use. May have feature limitations in trial. Examples: WinZip, older software model. Less common now (subscription models replaced it)."
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    front: "What are open source license types you should know?",
    back: "GPL (GNU General Public License - modifications must be open source), MIT (permissive, can use in proprietary), Apache (similar to MIT, patent protection), BSD (very permissive). Copyleft (GPL) vs permissive (MIT, BSD). Must follow license terms."
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    front: "What is personal vs commercial use licensing?",
    back: "Personal: use at home, non-business purposes, often free or cheaper. Commercial: business use, usually requires paid license, higher cost. Examples: WinRAR free for personal, paid for business. Using personal license commercially violates terms."
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    front: "What is a concurrent license?",
    back: "Limited number of simultaneous users, not tied to specific devices/users. Example: 50 licenses = 50 people can use simultaneously, but 200 employees total. License server tracks usage. Common for expensive software (CAD, engineering). Cost-effective for shared use."
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    front: "What is software piracy and what are the consequences?",
    back: "Using software without valid license: cracked software, keygen usage, sharing licenses, using expired licenses. Consequences: legal action/fines (up to $150,000 per title), criminal charges possible, malware risk, no support/updates, termination if employee, company liability."
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    front: "What is a site license?",
    back: "Unlimited installations within specific location (building, campus). Pay one fee for entire site. Common in: schools, large corporations. Cost-effective for many users in one location. Terms define geographic boundaries. May exclude remote workers."
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    front: "What is license compliance and why does it matter?",
    back: "Using software according to license terms - correct number of installations, proper use type, valid licenses. Matters because: legal requirement, avoid fines, software audits, ethical obligation, company reputation. Maintain license inventory and documentation."
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    front: "What is a software audit and how should you prepare?",
    back: "Vendor verifies license compliance. Prepare: inventory all installed software, gather purchase records/receipts, match installations to licenses, uninstall unlicensed software, document everything. Vendors (Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle) can audit. Non-compliance = fines, forced purchases."
  },
  {
    id: 21,
    front: "What license documentation should you maintain?",
    back: "Purchase receipts, product keys, license agreements, email confirmations, volume licensing agreements, maintenance/support contracts. Store securely (digital and physical backup), organize by software, keep accessible for audits, retain even after software uninstalled (proof of purchase)."
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    front: "What is license transferability?",
    back: "Ability to transfer license to new owner/device. Varies by license: some allow (OEM Windows with PC sale), some prohibit (non-transferable), some require vendor approval. Check EULA. Important when: selling computer, changing hardware, transferring to new employee."
  },
  {
    id: 23,
    front: "What is OEM licensing?",
    back: "Original Equipment Manufacturer license - comes with new PC, tied to that hardware, typically non-transferable. Cheaper than retail but limited. Windows OEM: can't move to new PC. Support from PC manufacturer, not software vendor. Pre-installed on new systems."
  },
  {
    id: 24,
    front: "What is retail vs OEM licensing for Windows?",
    back: "Retail: full version, transferable to new PC, Microsoft support, more expensive, includes installation media. OEM: tied to original PC, non-transferable, manufacturer support, cheaper, pre-installed. Retail better for flexibility, OEM fine if keeping PC."
  },
  {

  {
    id: 26,
    front: "What is CAL (Client Access License)?",
    back: "Microsoft license for accessing server software (Windows Server, Exchange, SQL Server). Types: User CAL (per user, multiple devices), Device CAL (per device, multiple users). Need server license PLUS CALs for each user/device accessing. Common confusion point."
  },
  {
    id: 27,
    front: "What rights does a software license typically NOT grant?",
    back: "Ownership of software (only right to use), right to reverse engineer, right to modify (unless open source), unlimited installations (usually specified number), resale rights (usually), removal of copy protection, redistribution. License grants usage rights, not ownership."
  },
  {

    front: "What is license harvesting/reclamation?",
    back: "Recovering unused licenses from: former employees, decommissioned computers, unused installations. Reassign to new users. Manage license pool efficiently. Use license management software to track. Especially important for expensive software (Adobe, AutoCAD). Reduces costs."
  },
  {
    id: 29,
    front: "What should you do when employee leaves company?",
    back: "Deactivate/unassign their software licenses, revoke account access, reclaim assigned licenses, document license return, reassign to new employee if needed, ensure no personal licensed software on company hardware, remove from license management system."
  },
  {
    id: 30,
    front: "What is the difference between a license and a warranty?",
    back: "License: legal right to use software, defines usage terms, doesn't guarantee it works. Warranty: guarantee software will function as described, vendor's liability for defects, usually limited. Most software sold 'as-is' with limited warranty. Read both carefully."
