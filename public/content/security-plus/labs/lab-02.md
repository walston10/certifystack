### Activity F: Have I Been Pwned Research

**Goal:** Understand the scale of data breaches and how stolen data enables attacks.

**Visit haveibeenpwned.com (safe, legitimate security site by Troy Hunt):**

**1. Check breach statistics (no personal email needed):**

Navigate to the main page and find:

| Statistic | Current Number |
|-----------|----------------|
| Total breached accounts | |
| Total paste accounts | |
| Total breached websites | |

**2. Explore notable breaches:**

Click "Who's been pwned" and research THREE major breaches:

| Breach | Date | Accounts Affected | Data Exposed | Breach Description |
|--------|------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1. | | | | |
| 2. | | | | |
| 3. | | | | |

**3. Optional - Check your own email (your choice):**

If you're comfortable, check if your email appears in known breaches:

- Did your email appear in any breaches? [ ] Yes [ ] No [ ] Didn't check
- If yes, which breaches? _______________________
- What data was exposed? _______________________
- Have you changed your password since? [ ] Yes [ ] No

**4. How attackers use breach data:**

Explain how each threat actor type might use stolen credentials:

| Threat Actor | How They'd Use Breach Data |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Organized crime | |
| Nation-state | |
| Unskilled attacker | |
| Insider threat | |

### Activity G: Shadow IT Discovery

**Goal:** Identify unauthorized applications and services that create security risks.

**Shadow IT** = Technology used without IT department approval or knowledge.

**Common Shadow IT examples - check which exist in your environment:**

|------|--------------------------------|
| Data leakage | |
| Compliance violations | |
| No security controls | |
| No backups | |
| Credential exposure | |

### Activity H: Threat Actor Attribution Challenge

**Goal:** Practice identifying threat actors based on attack characteristics.

**Read each scenario and determine the most likely threat actor type:**

**Scenario 1:**
A sophisticated attack targets multiple defense contractors over 24 months. The malware uses zero-day exploits, communicates with command servers in a specific country, and carefully exfiltrates technical documents about weapons systems. The attackers maintain access even after partial detection, adapting their techniques.

- **Most likely threat actor:** _______________________
- **Key indicators that led to your conclusion:**
  1. _______________________
  2. _______________________
  3. _______________________

**Scenario 2:**
A hospital's systems are encrypted by ransomware. The attackers demand $2 million in Bitcoin. They threaten to leak patient data if not paid. The ransomware variant is commercially available on dark web forums.

- **Most likely threat actor:** _______________________
- **Key indicators:**
  1. _______________________
  2. _______________________
  3. _______________________

**Scenario 3:**
After a controversial company decision makes news, their website is defaced with protest messages. Customer data is leaked online. The attackers post manifestos on social media claiming responsibility.

- **Most likely threat actor:** _______________________
- **Key indicators:**
  1. _______________________
  2. _______________________
  3. _______________________

**Scenario 4:**
An IT administrator who was denied a raise exports customer databases to a personal drive. Two weeks later, after resigning, they delete critical system configurations and backups.

- **Most likely threat actor:** _______________________
- **Key indicators:**
  1. _______________________
  2. _______________________
  3. _______________________

**Scenario 5:**
A gaming company's servers are repeatedly knocked offline by DDoS attacks. The attacks use commonly available tools and hit during peak gaming hours. Anonymous forum posts take credit, mocking the company's security.

- **Most likely threat actor:** _______________________
- **Key indicators:**
  1. _______________________
  2. _______________________
  3. _______________________

## Section 3: Reflection Scenarios (5 min)

**Think through these situations:**

**Scenario 1:** Your organization is a pharmaceutical company developing a COVID vaccine. You've heard about nation-state attacks on vaccine research. What threat actors should you be most concerned about, and what would they want?

_________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________

**Scenario 2:** You notice a coworker has been acting stressed, talking about financial problems, and staying late after everyone else leaves. They have access to customer payment information. What type of threat might this represent, and what should you do?

_________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________

**Scenario 3:** Your company just had a very public layoff that made national news. Some former employees expressed anger on social media. What threat actor types might target your organization in the coming weeks?
