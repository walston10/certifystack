# Lab 54: Environmental Controls - SOLUTION

---

## Section 1: Concept Check - Answers

### Question 1: Server Room Temperature

**Ideal range:** 64-75°F (18-24°C)

ASHRAE recommendations allow up to 80.6°F (27°C) for short periods, but cooler is generally better for equipment longevity. Modern guidelines have relaxed somewhat to save energy.

---

### Question 2: Humidity Control

**Importance:**
- **Too high (>60%):** Condensation on components, corrosion, electrical shorts
- **Too low (<40%):** Increased ESD risk, static electricity buildup

**Ideal range:** 40-60% relative humidity

**Control methods:** HVAC systems, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, sealed rooms

---

### Question 3: Surge Protector vs UPS

| Feature | Surge Protector | UPS |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| Blocks power spikes | Yes | Yes |
| Provides backup power | No | Yes |
| Allows graceful shutdown | No | Yes |
| Conditions power | Basic | Yes (varies) |
| Cost | $20-100 | $100-1000+ |

**Surge protector:** Protects against spikes but provides no power during outage
**UPS:** Provides both protection AND backup power

---

### Question 4: Hot Aisle/Cold Aisle

**Concept:** Organizing server racks to separate hot exhaust air from cold intake air

- **Cold aisle:** Equipment fronts face each other, receive cooled air
- **Hot aisle:** Equipment rears face each other, exhaust hot air
- **Benefit:** More efficient cooling, prevents hot air recirculation
- **Containment:** Physical barriers to keep hot and cold air separated

---

### Question 5: HVAC

**Stands for:** Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning

**Critical for IT because:**
- Removes heat generated by equipment
- Maintains optimal temperature
- Controls humidity
- Filters air (reduces dust)
- Provides fresh air circulation

**Failure consequences:** Equipment overheating, thermal shutdown, component damage, fire risk

## Section 2: Activities - Answers

### Activity A: Temperature and Humidity

**Optimal conditions:**

| Environment | Temperature | Humidity |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Server room | 64-75°F (18-24°C) | 40-60% |
| Data center | 64-80°F (18-27°C) | 40-60% |
| Office | 68-76°F (20-24°C) | 30-60% |
| Storage | 50-85°F (10-29°C) | 30-60% |

**Effects outside range:**

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Too hot | CPU throttling, shutdown, component failure, shorter lifespan |
| Too cold | Condensation when warming up, slower startup |
| Too humid | Condensation, corrosion, electrical shorts |
| Too dry | ESD damage, static shock |

**Monitoring methods:**

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Temperature sensors | Real-time temp monitoring |
| Humidity sensors | Track moisture levels |
| Environmental monitoring system | Centralized dashboard, trending |
| SNMP alerts | Automated notifications |

---

### Activity B: Power Protection

**Power problems:**

| Problem | Description | Effect |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Surge | Short voltage increase | Component damage |
| Spike | Brief, intense voltage | Immediate damage |
| Sag (brownout) | Voltage drop | Instability, data loss |
| Blackout | Complete power loss | Shutdown, data loss |
| Noise | EMI on power line | Data corruption |

**Protection comparison:**

| Device | Protects Against | Backup? | Use Case |
|--------|------------------|---------|----------|
| Surge protector | Surges, spikes | No | Desktops, peripherals |
| Line conditioner | Noise, minor fluctuations | No | Sensitive electronics |
| UPS (Standby) | Surges, short outages | Yes (delayed switch) | Basic computers |
| UPS (Line-interactive) | Surges, sags, outages | Yes (faster switch) | Servers, network |
| UPS (Online) | All power problems | Yes (continuous) | Critical systems |
| Generator | Extended outages | Yes (delayed start) | Data centers |

### Activity C: UPS Sizing

**Scenario 1: Small office**
- 5 PCs × 300W = 1,500W
- 5 monitors × 40W = 200W
- 1 switch × 100W = 100W
- **Total: 1,800W**
- **With margin: 1,800 × 1.25 = 2,250VA minimum**

**Scenario 2: Server closet**
- 2 servers × 500W = 1,000W
- 1 switch × 150W = 150W
- **Total: 1,150W**
- **With margin: 1,150 × 1.25 = 1,438VA minimum**
- For 15 minutes runtime at 1,150W: Need approximately 288 Wh battery capacity

### Activity D: Ventilation and Airflow

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Hot aisle | Aisle where equipment rears (exhausts) face |
| Cold aisle | Aisle where equipment fronts (intakes) face |
| Containment | Physical barriers separating hot/cold air |
| Raised floor | Plenum for cold air distribution from below |
| In-row cooling | AC units between racks for targeted cooling |

**Placement rules:**

| Rule | Why Important |
|------|---------------|
| Fronts face cold | Equipment draws cool air from front |
| Rears face hot | Exhaust goes to hot aisle for extraction |
| Blanking panels | Prevents hot air recirculating to cold aisle |
| Cable management | Blocked airflow causes hot spots |
| Clear vents | Obstructions cause overheating |

**Hot/cold aisle layout:**

```
    COLD AISLE (AC output)
    ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
[RACK]  Front → ← Front  [RACK]
[RACK]  Front → ← Front  [RACK]
[RACK]  Front → ← Front  [RACK]
    ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑
    COLD AISLE (AC output)

    HOT AISLE (Return to AC)
    ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑
[RACK]  Back ← → Back  [RACK]
[RACK]  Back ← → Back  [RACK]
    ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
    HOT AISLE (Return to AC)
```

### Activity E: Fire Suppression

| System | How It Works | Pros | Cons |
|--------|--------------|------|------|
| Water sprinkler | Water on fire | Cheap, common | Destroys electronics |
| FM-200 | Chemical agent, removes oxygen | Safe for equipment | Expensive, limited |
| Inergen | Inert gases, reduces oxygen | Safe for equipment and people | Requires sealed room |
| CO2 | Displaces oxygen | Very effective | Dangerous to humans |
| Pre-action | Water held until two triggers | Less accidental discharge | Still uses water |

**For data center:** FM-200 or Inergen (clean agent systems)

**Why:** Won't damage equipment, safe for occupied spaces, fast acting, leaves no residue

---

### Activity F: Environmental Monitoring

**Monitoring thresholds:**

| Metric | Warning | Critical | Alert |
|--------|---------|----------|-------|
| Temperature | 78°F (26°C) | 85°F (29°C) | Email + SMS |
| Humidity | <35% or >65% | <30% or >70% | Email + SMS |
| UPS battery | <50% | <20% | Email + SMS + call |
| UPS load | >70% | >90% | Email |
| Power (utility) | Fluctuation | Loss | Immediate all |
| Water detection | Any | Any | Immediate |

**Escalation:**

| Level | Response | Contact |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Warning | 15 minutes | On-call tech |
| Critical | 5 minutes | Senior tech + manager |
| Emergency | Immediate | All hands + facilities |

## Section 3: Reflection - Answers

### Scenario 1: Weekend AC Failure

**Potential damage:**
- Hard drives may fail (thermal damage)
- CPUs may have throttled or shut down
- Capacitors stressed, shortened lifespan
- Possible data corruption during thermal shutdown
- Warranty may be void if temp exceeded specs

**Prevention:**
- Environmental monitoring with alerts
- Redundant cooling
- Automatic shutdown on high temp
- Weekend checks or monitoring service
- UPS with temperature shutdown feature

---

### Scenario 2: Surge Protectors Only

**Recommendations:**
1. **Critical systems need UPS** - Servers, switches, key workstations
2. **At minimum:** Small UPS for graceful shutdown
3. **Training:** Save work frequently, auto-save enabled
4. **Cloud backup:** Less dependent on local power
5. **Consider:** Laptop users continue during short outages

**Cost-effective approach:** UPS for critical equipment, surge protectors for peripherals

### Scenario 3: Server Closet Near Bathroom

**Environmental concerns:**
1. **Humidity:** Bathroom steam can increase humidity
2. **Water damage:** Pipe leaks, flooding risk
3. **Temperature:** Often not climate controlled
4. **Ventilation:** May be poor
5. **Access:** May be inconvenient

**Mitigation:**
- Install exhaust fan for heat
- Water leak sensors on floor
- Humidity monitoring
- Seal any shared walls
- Waterproof flooring
- Raise equipment off floor

---

### Scenario 4: FM-200 Discharge

**Immediate actions:**
1. **Evacuate if needed** (FM-200 is generally safe but reduces oxygen)
2. **Investigate cause** - Was there actually a fire?
3. **Ventilate room** before re-entry
4. **Check equipment** - Should be undamaged
5. **Document incident** for records
6. **Refill system** - FM-200 needs recharging after discharge
7. **Investigate trigger** - Why did it go off?
8. **Review and test** fire detection systems

**Equipment should be fine** - FM-200 is "clean agent" that doesn't damage electronics
